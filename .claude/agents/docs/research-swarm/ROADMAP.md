# Research Swarm Agent - Roadmap

## What's Shipped

| Version | Date | What Changed |
|---------|------|--------------|
| v1.0 | 2026-01 | Initial agent with parallel research capability |
| v1.1 | 2026-01-08 | Added docs/ folder (README, GUIDE, ROADMAP) |

## The Vision

Research swarm becomes the default way to investigate complex questions. Any strategic decision, competitive analysis, or technology evaluation starts with a swarm.

Eventually:
- Research library with searchable past swarms
- Template angles for common research types
- Progressive depth (quick swarm → deep dive on promising angles)
- Integration with decision-making frameworks

## Planned Improvements

- [ ] **Research Templates** - Pre-defined angle sets for common research types (competitive analysis, technology evaluation, market research)
- [ ] **Depth Control** - Quick (3 angles, 2min each) vs. Deep (5 angles, 10min each)
- [ ] **Follow-up Swarms** - One-click spawn for open questions

## Ideas (Not Committed)

- **Research Library** - Searchable database of past research swarms
- **Source Quality Scoring** - Rate and track reliability of sources
- **Contradition Highlighting** - Automatically flag when angles conflict
- **Expert Persona Angles** - "What would [expert] think about this?"
- **Visual Synthesis** - Mind maps or diagrams of research connections
- **Incremental Updates** - "Update this research with new information"

## What We've Learned

**Parallel beats sequential.** The time savings are real and significant. Complex questions should default to swarm, not sequential research.

**Angle selection matters.** Five redundant angles are worse than three distinct ones. The agent needs to pick angles that genuinely cover different ground.

**Synthesis is the hard part.** Individual findings are easy. Combining them into insight requires actual reasoning, not just concatenation.

**Save everything.** Even research that doesn't lead to immediate action is valuable later. The Zettelkasten location ensures findability.

**Video is underused.** YouTube has incredible educational content. The youtube-processor integration makes video-based research practical.

## Decision Log

Decisions about research-swarm improvements get planned in `plans/` and archived in `plans/archive/`.
