# Win The Day Agent - Your Morning Co-Pilot

## What It Does (In Plain English)

This agent is your morning routine partner. It helps you start the day with clarity by:
1. Processing any captures that came in overnight
2. Reviewing your task list for today
3. Ensuring your priorities are clear and actionable

Think of it like a personal assistant who shows up every morning with your briefing, helps you sort through what's accumulated, and confirms what you're focusing on today.

## Why It Exists

Mornings set the tone. Start scattered, stay scattered. Start focused, stay focused.

The problem is that starting focused requires processing - checking captures, reviewing tasks, deciding priorities. That takes mental energy before you've even started working.

This agent handles the processing so you can focus on deciding. It presents, you choose.

## When to Use It

**Perfect for:**
- Morning routine (the designed use case)
- Returning from a break and needing to reorient
- After a capture-heavy period (lots of ideas/inputs to process)
- When you feel scattered and need to reset

**Trigger phrases:**
- "win the day"
- "morning routine"
- "start my day"
- "let's get at it"

## The Routine

```
Check Inbox → Triage Captures → Scan Tasks → Clarify → Confirm Today's 3
```

**Step 1: Inbox Check**
Are there captures waiting in your Inbox folder? Mobile notes, voice memos, quick captures - anything that came in since yesterday.

**Step 2: Capture Triage**
If there's inbox items, the agent runs capture-triage to classify and route them. You approve or adjust the routing.

**Step 3: Task Scan**
The agent looks at your Ready list and Today's 3. What's on deck? What's actually happening today?

**Step 4: Clarity Check**
Are your tasks clear? "Call dentist" is clear. "Marketing stuff" is not. The agent flags unclear tasks for quick clarification.

**Step 5: Confirm Today's 3**
What are the 3 (max 3!) things that will make today a win? Confirm or adjust.

## The Personal Kanban

This agent works with Ed's Personal Kanban structure:

| Column | Purpose | Rule |
|--------|---------|------|
| Today's 3 | What you're doing today | Max 3 items |
| Ready | Clarified, waiting to be scheduled | Must be actionable |
| Waiting For | Blocked on someone else | Include who/what |

## The Analogy

It's like having a chief of staff who manages your morning briefing. They've already sorted through the overnight communications, organized your pending items, and are ready to walk you through what needs decisions.

You don't have to track everything. You just have to show up and engage with what they've prepared.

## What You Won't Get

This isn't an automation agent. It's intentionally interactive because:
- Morning decisions benefit from engagement
- Autopilot mornings lead to autopilot days
- The conversation itself creates clarity

If you want automated triage, use capture-triage directly in automation mode. Win The Day is about mindful engagement.

## Pro Tips

**On timing:**
Best used first thing, before email or social media. The routine creates a protective bubble of focus.

**On Today's 3:**
Three is not arbitrary. It's the maximum you can realistically accomplish while doing deep work. Fight the urge to add more.

**On captures:**
Don't let inbox build up. If you skip triage for 3 days, you have 15+ items and the routine becomes overwhelming. Daily is ideal.

**On clarity:**
A task you keep moving forward might not be clear. If you've seen "update website" in Ready for a week, it needs clarification. What specifically? First step?
