# Win The Day Agent - Roadmap

## What's Shipped

| Version | Date | What Changed |
|---------|------|--------------|
| v1.0 | 2026-01 | Initial agent (as daily-review) |
| v1.1 | 2026-01-07 | Renamed to win-the-day, improved framing |
| v1.2 | 2026-01-08 | Added docs/ folder (README, GUIDE, ROADMAP) |

## The Vision

Win The Day becomes the consistent starting point for every productive day. A ritual that's both practical (processes real items) and psychological (creates focus and intention).

Eventually:
- Learn Ed's patterns (what tasks get done, what stalls)
- Proactive suggestions ("You've been avoiding X for 5 days...")
- Integration with calendar for time-blocking
- End-of-day counterpart (review what happened)

## Planned Improvements

- [ ] **Pattern Recognition** - Notice tasks that keep getting pushed forward
- [ ] **Calendar Awareness** - "You have 3 meetings today, maybe just 2 big tasks"
- [ ] **Weekly Rhythm** - Monday version includes weekly review

## Ideas (Not Committed)

- **End of Day Review** - Close the loop on what got done
- **Energy Matching** - "Your calendar is busy, pick easier tasks"
- **Streak Tracking** - Gamify the morning routine
- **Custom Prompts** - Personalized questions for the morning
- **Voice Mode** - Audio conversation instead of text
- **Templates** - Different routines for different day types

## What We've Learned

**Naming matters.** "Daily review" sounded like homework. "Win the day" sounds like possibility. Same functionality, different energy.

**Interaction is the feature.** This agent is intentionally not automated. The morning conversation creates engagement. Automating it would defeat the purpose.

**Today's 3 is strict.** Every attempt to push to 4 or 5 items degrades focus. Three is the magic number.

**Capture triage integration is essential.** The inbox builds up. If the morning routine doesn't include triage, items languish. The skills chain naturally.

## Decision Log

Decisions about win-the-day improvements get planned in `plans/` and archived in `plans/archive/`.
