# BALTHASAR - Roadmap

## What's Shipped

| Version | Date | What Changed |
|---------|------|--------------|
| v1.0 | 2026-01 | Initial MAGI agent with mission-context skill |
| v1.1 | 2026-01-08 | Added docs/ folder (README, GUIDE, ROADMAP) |

## The Vision

BALTHASAR becomes the definitive "voice and audience" agent - the one that ensures everything Ed builds actually connects with the people he serves.

Long-term, BALTHASAR could:
- Automatically review all content for voice consistency
- Build and maintain audience personas
- Guide other agents on "human impact" considerations
- Act as the empathy check before anything ships

## Planned Improvements

- [ ] **Audience Database Integration** - Connect to Ed's CRM/contact notes for richer audience understanding
- [ ] **Voice Style Guide** - Maintain a living document of Ed's voice patterns that BALTHASAR references
- [ ] **Content Review Automation** - Review all newsletter drafts before final publish

## Ideas (Not Committed)

- **Sentiment Analysis** - Gauge emotional tone of content against audience expectations
- **Testimonial Mining** - Pull success stories and language from client feedback
- **Competitive Voice Analysis** - How does Ed's voice differ from others in the space?
- **Coaching Framework Library** - Database of Ed's frameworks for quick application

## What We've Learned

The MAGI system works because each agent has a clear lane. BALTHASAR's lane is "people and meaning" - when it strays into technical territory, it should hand off to MELCHIOR.

The mission-context skill is essential - BALTHASAR without context about Ed's business is just generic empathy. The skill provides the specific knowledge that makes BALTHASAR useful.

## Decision Log

Decisions about BALTHASAR improvements get planned in `plans/` and archived in `plans/archive/`.
