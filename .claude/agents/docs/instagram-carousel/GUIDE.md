# Instagram Carousel Agent - From Article to Visual Story

## What It Does (In Plain English)

You have an article, a newsletter, or even just a good idea. This agent turns it into a complete Instagram carousel package - the slides, the copy, and the AI image prompts to generate the visuals.

It's like having a social media content team in a box. You feed in your long-form content, and out comes a ready-to-post carousel.

## Why It Exists

Instagram carousels are one of the highest-engagement content formats on the platform. But creating them is a multi-step process:
1. Distill your main idea into 10 slides
2. Write copy that works slide-by-slide
3. Design or generate visuals for each slide
4. Ensure visual consistency across all slides

This agent handles all of that. You focus on the idea. The agent handles the execution.

## When to Use It

**Perfect for:**
- Turning newsletter articles into social content
- Repurposing blog posts for Instagram
- Creating teaching carousels from frameworks
- Building brand content at scale

**Not for:**
- Photo carousels (multiple photos, no text overlay)
- Stories or Reels (different format)
- Content that doesn't have enough substance for 10 slides

## The Pipeline

```
Article → Hook Extraction → Story Arc → Slide Copy → Visual Planning → Image Prompts
```

**Stage 1: Hook Extraction**
What's the one thing that will stop the scroll? The agent finds your strongest hook and puts it on slide 1.

**Stage 2: Story Arc**
Carousels need flow. The agent structures your content with a beginning (hook), middle (value), and end (CTA).

**Stage 3: Slide Copy**
Each slide gets concise, punchy copy. No walls of text. Easy to read while scrolling.

**Stage 4: Visual Planning**
What should each slide show? The agent plans visuals that reinforce the message.

**Stage 5: Image Prompts**
Ready-to-use prompts for Nano Banana Pro. Include a reference photo and get consistent character across all slides.

## What You Get

A complete package folder with:
- **carousel-brief.md** - The strategy document (hook, audience, angle)
- **slides.md** - All slide copy in sequence
- **image-prompts.md** - Nano Banana Pro prompts for each visual

## The Analogy

Think of this like having a creative director who specializes in carousels. You hand them your article and say "make this work for Instagram." They come back with the complete package - you just need to generate the images and post.

## Pro Tips

**On character consistency:**
When generating images, use the same reference photo for all slides. Add "maintain consistent character appearance from reference" to each prompt.

**On slide count:**
10 slides is the sweet spot. Enough for substance, not so many that people drop off.

**On the hook:**
Slide 1 is everything. If it doesn't stop the scroll, the other 9 slides don't matter. The agent prioritizes finding the strongest possible hook.

## Example Transformation

**Input:** 1,500-word newsletter about "Why coaches should use AI"

**Output:**
- Slide 1: Hook - "The coaches winning in 2026 have one thing in common..."
- Slides 2-8: Key insights, examples, proof points
- Slide 9: Summary/framework
- Slide 10: CTA - "Follow for more AI coaching insights"

Plus image prompts for each slide featuring a consistent character (Ed) in relevant scenarios.
