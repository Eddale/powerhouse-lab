## READING PATHS (CHOOSE YOUR ADVENTURE)

### Path A: "Just Ship Something" (30 min)
1. Read: `WAITING-FOR-ROADMAP.md` (5 min)
2. Copy: Templates from `obsidian-templates/` (2 min)
3. Build: iOS shortcut from `ios-shortcut-waiting-for.md` (10 min)
4. Test: Create 1 waiting-for note (5 min)
5. Iterate: Adjust based on what feels clunky (8 min)

**Output:** Working Phase 1 system

---

### Path B: "Understand Then Build" (60 min)
1. Read: `WAITING-FOR-SUMMARY.md` (10 min)
2. Read: `waiting-for-tracking-research.md` (30 min)
3. Read: `waiting-for-implementation-guide.md` (15 min)
4. Decide: Which phase to start?
5. Build: Follow implementation guide (next session)

**Output:** Deep understanding + clear plan

---

### Path C: "I Want Automation Now" (Don't Do This)
1. ~~Skip to `gmail-api-automation-concept.py`~~
2. ~~Try to implement without testing pattern~~
3. ~~Get frustrated with complexity~~

**Output:** Frustration

**Instead:** Do Path A for 2 weeks, THEN consider automation

## QUICK ANSWERS

### "How long to build Phase 1?"
**30-60 minutes** if you follow the implementation guide

### "Do I need to code?"
**Phase 1:** No, just copy/paste templates
**Phase 2/3:** Yes, Python + Gmail API

### "What if I don't use Obsidian?"
Use any note-taking app with:
- File-based notes (Markdown)
- Template support
- Search/query capability

Examples: Notion, Logseq, Apple Notes (basic)

### "Can I skip to Phase 2?"
You CAN, but you SHOULDN'T.

Phase 1 teaches you the workflow. You need to know what to automate before you automate it.

### "What if the manual system works fine?"
**Then stick with it!**

Automation is NOT the goal. The goal is "never drop the ball."

If Phase 1 achieves that, you're done. Ship it and move on.

## SUPPORT RESOURCES

### If You Get Stuck

**Obsidian issues:**
- Check Dataview plugin is installed
- Verify folder paths match exactly
- Test with simple query first

**iOS Shortcut issues:**
- Start with minimal version (just 3 inputs)
- Test file creation in Files app first
- Check Obsidian Advanced URI plugin

**Workflow issues:**
- Are you logging too much? (Be selective)
- Are expected dates realistic? (3-5 days, not 1)
