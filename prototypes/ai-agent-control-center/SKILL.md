## 🎯 Purpose
To provide a "Flight Control" view of all autonomous agents, ensuring that:
1.  Tasks are captured in a central Inbox.
2.  Active agents are monitored for status.
3.  Completed work is archived and retrievable.

## 🛠️ Capabilities
-   **Inbox Monitor**: Scans `Agent Inbox.md` for new tasks.
-   **Dispatcher**: Assigns tasks to the appropriate specific agent/skill (e.g., Newsletter, Carousel).
