# 🎮 AI Agent Control Center

> **Status**: 🟡 Prototype
> **Type**: System / Workflow

## 💡 The Big Idea
A "Personal AI Operating System" that acts as the central hub for your coaching business. It leverages Obsidian for storage and GitHub for skill definitions, creating a seamless loop where agents pick up tasks, execute them using defined skills, and report back.

## 🎯 Objectives
1.  **Centralize**: One place to view all active AI work.
2.  **Standardize**: A common way to trigger and track any agent.
3.  **Scale**: Run multiple agents (Content, Training, Admin) without losing context.

## 🏗️ Structure
-   **`Agent Inbox.md`**: The drop-zone for new requests.
-   **`Active Agents.md`**: The live dashboard of running tasks.
-   **`SKILL.md`**: The definition of the "Manager" agent.
