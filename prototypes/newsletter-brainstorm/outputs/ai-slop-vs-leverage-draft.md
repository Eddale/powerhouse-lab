# Why You're Producing AI Slop Instead of AI Leverage — What a World-Class Copywriter Is Doing Differently After 20 Years of Wins, Failures, and Running Out of Runway

## The Pluribus Problem

I watched Pluribus last week.

If you haven't seen it — it's Vince Gilligan's new show. Rhea Seehorn plays Carol, one of only 13 people on Earth immune to an alien virus that's turned everyone else into a peaceful, content hive mind.

Sounds like paradise, right? No conflict. No friction. Everyone's happy.

Except Carol.

She's the outsider. At first she loves the freedom — she can go anywhere, take anything, no one's in her way. But by episode 7, the loneliness creeps in. She stops caring. A firework launcher tips toward her face and she doesn't even move.

Then she paints two words on the street: "Come back."

I sat on my couch watching that scene and thought: *That's me.*

Not the hive mind part. The outsider part.

I'm starting a new business at 55. Going solo. Betting on AI as my leverage instead of building another team. Stepping outside what everyone else seems to be doing.

And there's a part of me that wonders: do I end up like Carol? Isolated, burnt out, painting "come back" on the street?

Here's the difference I'm betting on: I'm not actually alone. I'm building a team of AI agents. That's the play — leverage without the isolation.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

## 480,000 People Later, I'm Starting Over

Some context.

I created the 30 Day Challenge. Taught 480,000 people how to make their first dollar online. Moved my family across the globe to study directly with Gary Halbert. Partnered with Frank Kern. Co-founded MagCast.

I've had the wins.

I've also had the failures. The projects that burned runway. The partnerships that didn't work. The teams I couldn't manage.

And now I'm starting over. At 55. With a new model, a new audience, and everything on the line.

What does that feel like?

50% terror. When you've built something that reached 480,000 people, there's a legacy to live up to. A standard. What if this one doesn't work?

50% liberation. I'm not starting from zero. I'm carrying 20 years of lessons — wins *and* failures — plus three years of bleeding-edge AI work that most people haven't touched yet.

It's time.

Not "maybe it's time" or "I'm thinking about it."

It's time.

## Three Runways, All Shrinking

Here's the honest truth: I'm running out of runway.

Not one runway. Three.

**Money runway.** I left Level 5. High expenses. Cashflow pressure. This isn't theoretical — this needs to work.

**Energy runway.** The Level 5 situation burnt me out. I'm too tired to exercise. The tank is low. I'm rebuilding, but I'm not 30 anymore.

**Relevance runway.** I'm the acknowledged expert right now. Three years of groundbreaking AI work. But that window doesn't stay open forever. Sit on it too long and someone else owns the narrative.

Three runways. All shrinking. All pointing to the same conclusion.

Now.

## What 20 Years of Wins and Failures Actually Taught Me

Here's what I learned the hard way:

**Lesson 1: I was too far ahead of the game.**
I kept building things before the market was ready. Visionary, sure. Also painful. This time I'm building for where people are, not where I see them going.

**Lesson 2: I worked with the wrong audience.**
The 30 Day Challenge was "first dollar online." Beginners. This time I'm serving established coaches — people who already have IP, clients, and revenue. People who have something to amplify.

**Lesson 3: I'm a terrible manager.**
I tried building teams. It became a liability, not leverage. I don't want to manage people. I want leverage that doesn't require management.

**Lesson 4: Partners aren't always the answer.**
I always had partners. It wasn't always a good thing. This time I'm going solo. I own the outcome.

Four lessons. Four things I'm not doing again.

## The Team I'll Never Mismanage

So if I can't manage people... how do I get leverage?

I build a team of AI agents.

This idea came from watching Ash Maurya build Lean Spark. He noticed that coding agents work because software development follows a **plan-code-test cycle** with clear success criteria. The agent sets a goal, tries something, checks if it worked, and iterates.

That's called an agentic loop. And it changes everything.

Ash asked: could this loop apply to business model development?

I asked: could this loop apply to running a coaching business?

The answer is yes.

Instead of hiring people I'll mismanage, I'm building AI agents that run their own loops. Each one has a job. Each one follows my methodology. Each one iterates toward a clear outcome — autonomously.

The newsletter brainstorming skill I built this week? That's Agent #1. A 7-phase process that extracts content from my experiences and turns it into a draft. I talk, it asks questions, we iterate until I have something to publish.

No management required.

That's the team I'll never mismanage.

## The Agentic Loop That Changes Everything

Most people use AI like a vending machine.

Put in a prompt. Get an output. Done.

That's treating AI like a tool. Like Excel. Input, output, move on.

Jensen Huang said it better: **"AI is not a tool. AI is work."**

That landed for me. Within 24 hours of hearing it, I tested a strategic brainstorming prompt with Claude and realized I wasn't typing into software — I was collaborating with a strategic partner.

The AI asked questions. I answered. More questions. Better answers. We iterated together.

I measured a **285% engagement increase** using collaborative prompts versus solo writing.

Here's why that matters for coaches:

Your genius emerges when you're answering questions. Not when you're staring at a blank page grinding out content. Not when you're fighting resistance. When someone asks you the right question, the insight flows.

The agentic loop gives you that. It's not input-output. It's collaboration. It's flow.

And for coaches — who spend their whole careers asking great questions — it's the most natural way to work with AI.

## Why I Have to Be My Own First Case Study

Here's the thing about teaching something: you can do it from theory, or you can do it from experience.

The energy is different. The certainty is different. The way you handle the hard questions is different.

I've been around long enough to know the difference.

So I'm going first.

I'm building my own AI Amplified Coaching Powerhouse — using the same skills, the same agentic loops, the same framework I'm going to teach. Every agent I build, I test on my business first. Every process I develop, I run myself.

The newsletter skill I mentioned? I used it to write this article. Meta-recursive dogfooding, Ash Maurya calls it.

I call it: you can't fake conviction.

Credibility gets you the meeting. Case studies help you close. But conviction? Conviction comes from doing it yourself first. From knowing — not believing, *knowing* — that it works because you've lived it.

That's why I have to be my own first case study.

## What This Means If You're an Established Coach Producing AI Slop

If any of this landed — the shrinking runways, the pattern of dabbling without leverage, the sense that everyone else is moving faster — you're not alone.

That's exactly where I was.

The difference is I'm doing something about it. And I'm documenting the whole thing.

Here's what I'm building:

**The AI Amplified Coaching Powerhouse** — a small group of established coaches earning $30k+ a month who want real AI leverage, not more toys.

In the first 30 days, you'll have your first AI leverage tool deployed live in your business.

Then we build a repeatable system — your own Leverage Skunkworks — using the same agentic loop, the same skills approach, the same model I'm running on myself.

10 spots. $2,500/month. You're not buying a course — you're joining the experiment.

If you're done dabbling and ready to build something real, reply and tell me what you're working on.

I'll tell you if it's a fit.
