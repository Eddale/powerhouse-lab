# Newsletter Brainstorm - Build Plan

## CURRENT FOCUS
```
Working on: Newsletter Brainstorm skill v0.1
Why: Eliminate blank page paralysis for Little Blue Report, create first Powerhouse prototype
Next: Test with real topic, refine prompts, promote to skills/
```

---

## Session Goal
Ship a working v0.1 that Ed can use THIS WEEK to brainstorm a real newsletter edition.

## Plays Shortlist (Riskiest Assumption First)

### Phase 1: Build the Skill
- [ ] Write the System Prompt (the 7-phase brain - extraction → headlines → outline → content)
- [ ] Create supporting artifact files:
  - [ ] `idea-questions.md` - Question bank for Phase 1 extraction
  - [ ] `outliner.md` - 10 post type formats
  - [ ] `section-writer.md` - 14 "Magical Ways" to expand
  - [ ] `newsletter-format.md` - Little Blue Report style guide
- [ ] Write the User Prompt Template (the opening conversation starter)
- [ ] Update SKILL.md with complete architecture

### Phase 2: Test & Validate
- [ ] Test with one real topic Ed is considering
- [ ] Refine based on output quality
- [ ] Add real example to SKILL.md

### Phase 3: Promote or Iterate
- [ ] Ed uses it for an actual newsletter
- [ ] Capture what worked / what didn't
- [ ] Decide: promote to skills/ or iterate more?

---

## Riskiest Assumption
**Can we capture Ed's editorial voice and Hook Stack framework in a prompt that produces genuinely useful angles, not generic AI slop?**

If this doesn't work, the whole skill is just another content generator. The magic is in the specificity.

---

## Success Signals
- [ ] Output feels like "me" not "AI"
- [ ] At least one angle per topic that surprises/delights
- [ ] Subject lines I'd actually consider using
- [ ] Outline gives me a running start, not just headers

---

## Kill Rules
- If after 3 prompt iterations we're still getting generic output, stop and rethink the approach
- If it takes more than 90 minutes to get a working v0.1, we've overcomplicated it
