# Newsletter Brainstorm - Build Plan

## CURRENT FOCUS
```
Working on: Newsletter Brainstorm skill v0.1
Why: Eliminate blank page paralysis for Little Blue Report, create first Powerhouse prototype
Next: Test with real topic, refine prompts, promote to skills/
```

---

## Session Goal
Ship a working v0.1 that Ed can use THIS WEEK to brainstorm a real newsletter edition.

---

## Plays Shortlist (Riskiest Assumption First)

### Phase 1: Core Prompts (The Brain)
- [ ] Draft system prompt that captures Ed's voice and Hook Stack thinking
- [ ] Draft user prompt template with clear input structure
- [ ] Test with one real topic Ed is considering
- [ ] Refine based on output quality

### Phase 2: Skill Documentation
- [ ] Update SKILL.md with working prompts
- [ ] Add real example from Phase 1 test
- [ ] Document any learnings

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Ed uses it for an actual newsletter
- [ ] Capture what worked / what didn't
- [ ] Decide: promote to skills/ or iterate more?

---

## Riskiest Assumption
**Can we capture Ed's editorial voice and Hook Stack framework in a prompt that produces genuinely useful angles, not generic AI slop?**

If this doesn't work, the whole skill is just another content generator. The magic is in the specificity.

---

## Success Signals
- [ ] Output feels like "me" not "AI"
- [ ] At least one angle per topic that surprises/delights
- [ ] Subject lines I'd actually consider using
- [ ] Outline gives me a running start, not just headers

---

## Kill Rules
- If after 3 prompt iterations we're still getting generic output, stop and rethink the approach
- If it takes more than 90 minutes to get a working v0.1, we've overcomplicated it
