# Newsletter Format - The Little Blue Report Style Guide

Style guide for writing newsletters in Ed's voice for The Little Blue Report (Substack).

---

## Headline Structure

**Main headline:** Specific outcome or journey
- Example: "From Prompt To Product: How I Turned One Claude Project Into A Client Getting Tool"

**Subtitle:** Series context + promise
- Example: "Prompt Whispering Part 2: The Simple Way To Turn A Working Prompt Into An AI Lead Magnet"

---

## Opening Hook

1. **Callback** to previous content or shared context (if applicable)
2. **Identify the wall/problem** fast
3. **Connect:** "You've probably hit this same wall" or similar
4. **Promise** what this piece delivers

---

## Subhead Style

Use **story-driven hooks**, NOT numbered steps.

**Good examples:**
- "The 'Poison' Warning"
- "More Than a GPT"
- "The Punk Rock Moment"
- "The 90-90 Rule"
- "Cut the Red Wire"
- "One Click to Live"

Each subhead is a **tease**, not a description. Make the reader want to know what's behind it.

---

## Pacing

- **Short paragraphs** (1-3 sentences)
- **Lots of white space**
- First-person narrative throughout
- Include **quotes from actual conversations** (with Claude, with colleagues, with clients)
- **Self-deprecating humor** works well ("Probably more David Brent than Rick Rubin")

---

## Image Placement

- Screenshots of actual tools or results
- Placed to break up text and prove points
- Strategic, not decorative

---

## Voice & Tone

- **Conversational** - like talking to a smart friend
- **Enthusiastic but grounded** - not hype, but genuine excitement
- **Teaching through story** - the lesson emerges from the journey
- **References that land** with the audience (Rick Rubin, punk rock, coaching metaphors)
- **Self-aware** about the process - share the struggle, not just the win

---

## Closing Structure

1. **Tease next part** (if series)
2. **P.S.** with link to working tool/resource
3. **P.P.S.** with secondary CTA (optional)

---

## Signature Phrases & Patterns

- "Here's the thing about..."
- "That's what Part X is about."
- Ellipses for pacing and emphasis...
- Questions that transition: "So what if...?"
- "Spoiler alert:"

---

## What to Avoid

- Generic AI-sounding language
- Overexplaining
- Numbered steps when story format works better
- Dry, instructional tone
- Burying the lesson in too much setup
