# Newsletter Brainstorm

## What This Does
Generates hook angles, subject lines, and rough outlines for The Little Blue Report newsletter based on a topic or theme.

## Who It's For
Ed (and eventually Powerhouse members who publish regular content)

## The Problem It Solves
Blank page paralysis. Instead of staring at a cursor, you get a menu of angles to choose from and a structure to start writing.
