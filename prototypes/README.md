# Prototypes

Works in progress. Experiments. Things being tested.

## Rules of the Prototypes Folder

1. **Ship fast** - 30-90 minutes to v1
2. **Document as you go** - It becomes training content
3. **Apply kill rules** - If it's not working after 3 loops, archive it
4. **Promote winners** - Move to `/skills` when validated
