# Black Belt Salesless Joke - How It Works

## The One-Sentence Version

It's a joke landing page where you literally can't book a call - because the button runs away from your mouse.

## Why This Exists

In December 2024, Taki Moore did something insane. He locked his 9-person sales team in a cupboard for 90 days. Full pay. Zero calls allowed. Just to test if his document could sell without human intervention.

Result? The document beat the sales team. Every. Single. Month.

Now Black Belt signs a new member every 23 hours with zero salespeople. The "Salesless Experiment" became permanent.

This page celebrates that story in the most on-brand way possible - by making it literally impossible to book a call.

## The Joke

You land on the page. You see "Book A Call" - a beautiful gold button. You try to click it.

It runs away.

You chase it. It taunts you with karate-themed messages:
- "OSS! TOO SLOW! 🥋"
- "WHITE BELT ENERGY 🤍"
- "SENSEI SAYS: READ THE DOC 📜"

After 10 jumps, it gets tired. "Fine. You win. Click me. 🏳️"

You click. A modal appears: "Wait... you actually caught it?"

Then the punchline explodes onto screen: "Just kidding. Read the document."

The only CTA that works takes you to the actual offer doc.

## The Messaging

The page tells the Salesless story through four reason cards:

1. **We Locked Them In A Cupboard** - The origin story
2. **The Doc Wins Every Time** - The results
3. **Because It's 2025, Bro** - The market shift
4. **Every 23 Hours** - The ongoing proof

Stats section reinforces: 0 salespeople, 23h between signups, 90 days to prove it, ∞ peace of mind.

## The Tech (For the Curious)

**Runaway mechanics:**
- Detection radius: 140px from cursor to button center
- Physics: Arc motion with squash/stretch animation
- Edge detection: Button jumps back to center when cornered
- Exhaustion: After 10 escapes, surrenders

**Explosion effect:**
- 30 gold particles burst outward
- Expanding ring burst
- Scale + rotation bounce on text/button
- Glow pulse on final CTA

All in a single HTML file. No framework. No build step. Deploys to Vercel in 8 seconds.

## The Pattern

This demonstrates a "content as experience" approach:

1. **The hook is the interaction** - Not the headline, the actual trying-and-failing
2. **The joke IS the message** - You can't book a call because docs work better
3. **Entertainment → Education** - Play the game, absorb the story, click the real CTA
4. **Shareability built in** - People will screenshot and share the taunts

## When To Use This Pattern

- Product launches that need buzz
- Counter-positioning against competition
- Making a philosophical point feel visceral
- Anything where "show don't tell" applies

The Salesless message hits harder when you experience it than when you read about it.
