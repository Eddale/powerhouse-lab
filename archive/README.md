Retired experiments. Kill rule applied.

## Why We Keep These

Failed experiments aren't failures - they're lessons. Before deleting anything, we capture:

1. **What we were trying to do**
2. **Why it didn't work**
3. **What we learned**

## Archive Format

When moving something here, add a `POSTMORTEM.md`:

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Postmortem

## The Goal
What were we trying to build?

## What Happened
Why did we stop?

## The Lesson
What do we know now that we didn't before?

## Salvageable Parts
Any prompts, code, or ideas worth reusing?
```
