# References Folder

Put documentation files here that Claude should read when needed.

**Why use references?**
- Keeps SKILL.md concise (under 5,000 tokens)
- Claude loads these only when the task requires them
- Supports progressive disclosure

**Example uses:**
- `API.md` - API documentation
- `EXAMPLES.md` - Detailed examples
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and fixes

**Tip:** All .md files in skill root are auto-loaded. Put detailed docs here instead.

Delete this README when you add your first reference file.
