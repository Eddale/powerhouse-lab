# Scripts Folder

Put executable Python or Bash scripts here.

**Why use scripts?**
- Scripts run WITHOUT loading into context (only their output uses tokens)
- Great for data processing, validation, code generation
- Claude executes via Bash and receives the output

**Example uses:**
- `process.py` - Transform data
- `validate.sh` - Check inputs
- `generate.py` - Create boilerplate code

Delete this README when you add your first script.
