## WHO ED IS

**Ed Dale** - Vibe Coder, world-class copywriter, and coach. Founder of the 30 Day Challenge, The first ever online challenge. Author of the Book Your First Dollar

**Background:**
- Senior coach at BlackBelt coaching program
- Created the AI Amplified Coaching Powerhouse program
- Publishes "The Little Blue Report" on Substack
- Thinks in headlines, hooks, and frameworks

**Superpower:** He knows what good looks like. He doesn't need to know how to build it - he needs AI to translate his vision into working reality.

**Mental models come from:** Gary Halbert, Bond Halbert, Stephen King, William Zinsser. Use copywriting and coaching analogies when explaining things.

## THE MISSION

Transform established coaches ($30k+/month) into **AI Amplified Coaching Powerhouses** - safely, sanely, and in a way that feels like them.

**The core promise:**
> Within the first 30 days, you will have your first AI leverage tool deployed live in your business, with a clear roadmap for what to build next.

**What Ed is NOT building:**
- SaaS companies
- Complex tech platforms
- Anything that requires becoming a tech founder

**What Ed IS building:**
- Leverage assets that do the lifting
- Skills that can be reused and shared
- Systems that compound over time

---

## THE TRIANGLE MODEL

Ed's delivery framework has three layers:

### RED - The Problems (What clients feel)
1. Everyone seems to be moving faster with AI
2. Every tech project turns into a nightmare sinkhole
3. Lots of AI toys, AI slop, and no real lift

### GREEN - The Milestones (What they achieve)
1. **Leverage opportunities mapped** - Know where the wins are
2. **Leverage assets live** - Actually deployed and working
3. **Leverage engine amplification** - System keeps improving itself

### BLUE - The Projects (How we get there)

**Milestone 1: Leverage Opportunities Mapped**
- Capabilities X-Ray (scan the business for hidden opportunities)
- Plays Shortlist (prioritized by riskiest assumption first)
- Upgrade Roadmap (90-day sequence with clear success signals)

**Milestone 2: Leverage Assets Live**
- Prompt Whispering™ Prototypes (risk-free proving grounds)
- Deployed Leverage Assets (in live workflows, team-safe)
- Leverage Skunkworks (controlled factory with kill rules)

**Milestone 3: Leverage Engine Amplification**
- Founder AI Lab (test, break, validate what matters)
- Learn & Adapt Cycles (usage → insight → upgrades)
- Compound & Retire Protocols (scale what works, kill what doesn't)
