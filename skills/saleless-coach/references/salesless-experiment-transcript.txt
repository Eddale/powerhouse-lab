All right.

Everybody take a big breath in and out.

One more in and out.

This is the thing I've been busting to share.

If it's cool with you, I would like to let this one rip a little bit.

We're going to go unplugged.

This has been a really exciting year for us, me, and our business.

At the Fiji event last year, our business looked one way,

and if you held up that business, the org chart, the marketing, the sales, the delivery,

and took a photo of that, and then you did the same for us right now,

we look like two completely different companies.

And we tried to do that as much as possible without it messing with you guys.

So we made a bunch of changes.

We had a team of 36 and it felt, frankly, for me, it felt really heavy.

I was doing heaps and heaps of operational manager-y stuff and I hated it.

Has anyone experienced that?

Yep.

Whether business is big or small, one of the core metrics I think we should be looking at

is what percentage of your week is spent doing stuff that actually lights you up.

And one of the key ways to get more of what actually lights you up

is to get rid of the shit you hate.

We had a conversation at Boardroom Dinner last night.

I can't remember who said it.

Maybe it was you, Alan.

Sometimes the biggest bang for buck,

juicy life upgrades you get

is just by removing the things you don't like,

even more than like adding something else

that's like 10% more fun.

And so a year ago,

we were 36 people on the team,

nine people in sales,

marketing a lot.

Every time somebody raised their pinky finger to like comment or like or engage in any way,

because the marketing wasn't working like it needed to,

the sales team had to like pounce.

Can we just say pounce?

You had to pounce on the leads.

And they'd be like in the DMs.

And then they'd be nudging and following up and chasing.

And then you're like trying to book a call and then the call wouldn't show up.

So then they'd chase the call and then they'd show up and then they'd like make the offer.

And if they bought, awesome.

If they didn't buy, then they'd follow up and follow up and follow up and chase and hound and pounce.

And it was a lot.

I'd already kind of taken on email as first challenge.

Like, I want to take back control of email, put out stuff that I'm actually proud of.

And so that was starting to work.

And in the last year, well, last six months, really, we've gotten serious about YouTube, serious about Instagram.

And it was like starting to work.

Are you with me so far?

But we had this sales team of nine people

and they were working really hard

because marketing, frankly,

wasn't delivering like it needed to.

And I think a lot of the reason

that we spend so much time focused on how do we sell

is because marketing is not working.

I had this kind of belief

that I reckon we could probably sell Black Belt with no calls,

like without a call.

And we hadn't done it, but I had a hunch.

You know when you've got a gut feeling

and you're like,

And you know it's right, but you don't have any evidence yet.

And full transparency, I love every person who was on our sales team.

Like, I really do.

And there's people there who I thought I'd work with ever until I was dead.

But I wanted to test selling without a call,

and it was not in their best interest for that experiment to work.

Right?

So, in the last six months, we've gone completely salesless.

And Ryan Dice sent me a text yesterday going,

hey, back in March, you said you were testing out this salesless thing.

Have you gone back to a sales team?

And I just all caps replied, we are never going back!

Because it's worked incredibly well.

So, here's what I want to do.

I want to talk about why this matters for you.

I'm not saying for a minute that you should go salesless.

you can and for some of you it's exactly the right move and for some of you you should just steal the

marketing and pre-sales piece that makes your call funnel just pop is that okay so with that

set as context can we i'll just share exactly what we've done is that all right all right let's do

this um here's the problem you spend hours and hours and hours on the phone trying to convince

people i don't know about you dude but i got into this thing to coach not to be on sales calls i got

good at the sales calls because it was like the necessary step but i never loved it so you go no

no i'm smarter than that tux i've worked on this thing and now i've built a sales team oh well

aren't you in for some fun because now you manage a freaking call center don't you

awesome um you either get good at sales calls and spend like frankly a big chunk of your week

doing sales calls or you hire a sales team and now you're hiring managing babysitting and uh

looking after a bunch of people who moan a lot.

Oh, there's not enough leads.

Okay, great.

I'll go back to the marketing.

Oh, there's lots of leads, but they're shit.

Can anyone relate to any of this?

Okay, I'm just saying it.

And here's the thing.

If I asked you this question,

I just want you to call that a yes or a no.

Do you, you're looking at something you'd like to buy

or you're interested in,

do you want a sales call as a potential client?

Do you want a sales call?

Right.

So if you don't want a sales call,

And I don't want a sales call.

And they don't want a sales call.

Why are we making that the only doorway into our world?

It's 2025, bro.

Sales calls are built for a world where you had all of the information.

Information was the scarce resource.

You had it and your salespeople were the bottleneck.

Like they were the gateway to get the stuff.

But now the information is free.

People are smart.

We've got the internet.

We've got GPT.

We've got all of the tools.

And I don't know about you, but I don't need a sales call to buy stuff.

I'm like a great buyer of stuff.

I take very little convincing.

All I need is I get excited about something,

I look a little bit,

and then I just want to know,

does it fix my problem?

How does it work?

And how much is it?

And then I'll happily send you the money,

large amounts of money.

I think your buyers are getting more and more and more like that.

So they hate them as much as you do.

And if you don't,

like if you're stuck in a sales process that you don't enjoy,

either managing a sales team or doing sales calls,

as your business gets bigger,

your life gets worse, not better. Is that okay to talk about? By the way, I'm acutely aware that

I've got some amazing clients in here and they build sales teams for people. And I'm really sorry

for that. Not sorry for your situation. Sorry for what I just said. Let me rephrase just for one

last time. For many of you guys, sales calls are exactly the right move for your business. For many

of you guys. And I want you to just take the marketing and the pre-selling piece of this and

keep your sales process exactly how it is for many of you guys. For some of you guys, you can come on

the fun train. So if we do this right, here's what happens. You're marketing pre-sales people.

Cialdini had this great book he wrote called Pre-Suasion. So if the marketing pre-sales people,

sales gets easy. When I first started, I was terrified of sales and shit scared of asking

for money. I don't know if any of you guys, like I was terrified, terrified. So I was like, man,

And if I can do really good marketing so people don't, I don't have to like arm twist or like

hear the rejection or any of that stuff, that's why I got good at marketing because I was

terrified.

I'm not scared of that anymore.

But now I still believe that great marketing makes sales easy and sometimes unnecessary.

So now our whole model runs no sales team at all.

We've gone from a team of 36 to a team of eight.

And we've gone from a sales team of nine to a sales team of zero.

So there's no one in the DMs, no appointment setters, no triages, no closers, no sales

manager, no one to manage the pipeline.

None of that.

and it feels really, really great.

Okay.

I think a lot of us focus on like the sales process

and we might be better off thinking about the buying process

because if we can create a buying environment,

the situation,

the circumstances around people

that make buying easy and fun,

they'll just buy.

Is that okay?

The whole goal of this, frankly,

is that as your business grows,

your life gets better,

not the other way around.

So let me tell you about an experiment that we ran.

This is, let me go to my book.

Let's sketch this thing out together.

this is in your book i think it's on page something page what it is on page something

okay uh what is it page 102 perfect okay so here was the here's the sitch the problem uh we had

nine people in sales uh marketing not working and so they had to pounce it was hard it felt heavy

and we were working harder and harder and harder and harder and harder and diminishing returns

So the hypothesis was, what if marketing got good?

What if we could make marketing great again?

If marketing got good, sales would be easy and maybe unnecessary.

Just to be super clear, we're still selling.

We're just doing it in marketing now, and we're doing a little bit of it in onboarding.

Sometimes people buy, and they're not quite a fit, and so we undo that thing.

So we wanted to run a test, and the test worked like this.

It involved two things.

It involved 90 days and a cupboard, a cupboard, a closet.

we locked the sales team in a cupboard for 90 days uh on full pay and said for whatever you do

don't talk to anybody don't send a dm don't book a call don't take a call no follow-ups no nothing

please just don't why did we lock them in a cupboard not just say sayonara well because

it was an experiment and it was a 50 50 chance that the whole thing horribly backfired and we

had to go back to the way it did and i have to eat humble pie is that cool so we started this in

January. And now it's July. So what happened in January? Oh, the goal was like, can we match the

sales team's numbers without them? And in January, our very first month when it was super rough and

clunky, we didn't just match their numbers, we beat them by a little bit. And then in Feb,

we beat them again. And then in March, we beat them by double. And then in April and in May

and in June, every month, literally every single month, it's got better. In June, we signed a new

black belt or boardroom every 23 hours with nobody in sales. And it's kind of awesome.

What's that? Oh, and in June, we had no workshop as well because I was in Italy having a good time

living my best life. Is this all right? So this is the big idea I want you to get.

There's two parts of your acquisition system. This is the next page in your book. You've got sales

and you've got marketing. And we were right down this end. Sales heavy, marketing light.

By the way, the sales team were doing the very, very best they could.

They were compensating for a lack of marketing.

I just want to be super clear.

And so we were sales heavy, marketing light.

You've probably experienced a little bit of that.

And the goal was to see what would happen if we just removed sales

and made marketing do the heavy lifting.

I would like to say we're here now.

The truth is we're probably more like we've definitely got no sales,

but the marketing is nowhere near as good as it could get.

Tony, I'm going to slide it from the right-hand side.

you tell me where you think we actually are. Say stop. More. More. Okay. She's got standards. Yeah,

yeah, yeah. I'm like, oh, it's working great. Here's what I want to know from you. If you had

to draw a line on your graph where you are right now, where are you at? What's your marketing to

sales ratio? Can you just draw that right now? You got 30 seconds, a little bit of music.

Have you got your spot? Let's call this one, this two, this three, and this position four.

If you're currently in position one, please raise your hand.

Okay, cool.

Thank you.

Twos?

Yep.

Threes?

Fours?

Okay.

So that's what I'd like to address.

Whether you keep sales the same or you nix it like we did, I think if we can make marketing

work better for you, everything else gets easy.

We did this with three things.

How many things?

Yeah, three things.

First, a doc.

What is it?

Yeah, a doc.

We took the offer, we worked on it, and we put it in a simple two-page document.

You've seen offer docs.

We've taught it in black belt before.

If you've got a doc, you can make some sales right now with no trouble this week.

Do you have enough to make sales every week?

Maybe, right?

Eventually, the people who've seen the doc need more.

So step one, we need a doc.

Step three, I'll come back to step two in a second.

Step three, we want demand.

What's the word?

Yeah, marketing that brings people in and warms them up to the point where on a scale from one to ten in terms of how likely they are to sign up and give you money,

they're an eight or a nine or a 10.

There's nothing worse than trying to sell

to ones, twos, and threes.

It's a waste of your time and their time.

So marketing's job is to bring people in

and warm them up to the point

they're an eight or a nine or a 10.

So that's demand.

With me so far?

Step two, the middle piece.

If you do this, you can make some sales this week.

If you do that, you'll have a bunch of like

primed people ready to go.

And then all we need is a reason

for them to take action right now.

Step two is a deadline.

So we've got a doc, we've got demand,

and a deadline is a weekly campaign that we run

that just has, here's the offer,

and a simple campaign that gets people to take action by Friday.

Does that make sense?

And that's the system.

Some of you guys, today, if you just go,

hey, I'm going to do the offer and make some sales,

amazing, you're going to crush this.

If you take that and you just add step two,

the weekly cycle, you'll do really, really well.

What's made this absolutely pop for us

is getting serious about content,

which is why I had Caleb here the last couple of days,

because that's our next move.

Cool?

Is this useful-ish so far?

Okay, why don't we just do this?

60-second chat, person next to you or in a group of three,

what about this is resonating with you?

Ready, set, go.

So let's get down to business.

Thank you.

I'm going to give you five keys for doing this well.

Each one of these just references someone smart

whose idea I've borrowed to make this thing work.

We're going to whip through these and then we're going to build.

First thing comes from my buddy Dan, Dan Martell,

long time friend and client in Black Belt first and then boardroom.

I don't want you to just build a big business.

I want you to build a big business that you love.

And you deserve to create a business that gives you exactly what you want

and exactly the way you want it.

And so if you want to build a sales team, you should freaking do that.

And if you love jamming on sales calls, you should do that.

If you love selling from workshops, you should do that.

You should build the business that you love.

And for me, the idea of teaching publicly lights me up a lot.

And the idea of sending people to sales calls or doing sales calls didn't light me up at all.

So I just decided that's not going to be the way we play.

Is that cool?

First big idea, do what you want.

Number two, this one's controversial.

Elon Musk doubled our business this year.

Thanks, Elon.

Super great.

Whether you love him or whether you hate him,

got to admit the dude knows a few things about doging processes.

Like legit.

He's got this five-step framework for, if you skip over a couple of pages, you can see Elon Musk's five-step design process.

He's got this five-step process for optimizing a process.

And it starts with, make the requirements less dumb.

In our world, there's a requirement that to sell something expensive, you need a sales call.

And that's a requirement that, firstly, I believed because that's how everyone did it.

And then I taught because that's all I knew.

And Elon's got this, like, Elon's really good at, like, questioning, is that actually true?

Do we actually need that?

And so if we make the requirements less dumb, like, what if you could sell it without it?

And so that was the first step, like, make the requirement less dumb.

If we could sell it without that, could we do it?

Yeah, I think we probably could.

So no calls.

Next step is to delete parts or processes.

So if we make the requirements less dumb, there's probably some other things you don't need to do also.

Things like, oh, crap.

Go away.

thanks

well if we don't need calls

then we don't need triage calls

and then we don't need sell by chat

people or sell by chat

you know, stuff

we don't need

on the people side, we don't need

sell by chat

we don't need triage people

we don't need strategy session people

we don't need a sales manager

we don't need whatever the name of the job is

of the person who looks at the pipeline

and we don't need any of that stuff

So we just nixed a bunch of pieces.

Are you following so far?

So then the step three is to simplify or optimize.

In a minute, I want to show you like what I think is the biggest golden nugget takeaway

of this whole thing, which is that you don't have a conversion rate problem.

You have a not enough people see your offer problem.

And so if the old process is like, you know, land on a core booking page and maybe book,

but maybe don't.

And then fill an application and maybe fill it in and maybe don't.

and then show up or don't,

and then triage in or out,

and then strategy session in or out.

Every one of those steps is awesome,

but there's also an opportunity for people

not to do the thing that we want them to do.

Would you agree?

And so simplify and optimize.

We basically just went from the old way,

which we'll talk about in a moment,

to a really simple process,

which is get as many eyeballs to the offer.

It's very simple.

It's like, hey, you, if you want these things,

here's how it works.

And then they can just self-check out

like it's amazon.com,

with way better margins.

Yeah?

And then we started to accelerate it.

And we accelerated it with a cadence.

And the cadence for us is monthly workshop,

weekly campaign.

I've got this thing going on where my,

it just keeps trying to connect me to a Wi-Fi network

and I don't need to or want to.

And then we automate.

So a bunch of the jobs that used to be done by these people

are now just simple systems like ManyChat automation.

And people fill in an application form

and it automatically either takes them to the doc

if they qualify or doesn't if they don't.

And then when they apply for Black Belt

after paying their deposit,

the only manual step in the whole process

is we review the application and we go,

yes, we can help you and we like you

or I don't think we're the right fit for you.

Does that make sense?

I think you're doing a lot of stuff

because we're supposed to

rather than questioning the requirements.

So what I'd love you to do is just take that page

and think about it.

I think we've got two copies.

There's like two pages with it on.

I want you to think about your current sales process

and go, are there any parts that I could simplify,

optimize, delete, accelerate, automate?

I'm just going to give you two minutes here

for a fast brainstorm on your current sales process.

What comes to mind,

even just having the conversation we've had so far

as an opportunity to simplify?

Does that make sense?

You've got two minutes, ready, set, go.

So there's parts of sales process we can work on,

tweak, improve, remove.

The big thing that makes this work is by focusing on what happens before sales happens.

And so my buddy Hutto invented this incredible model.

That's Hutto tasting Vegemite for the first time and realizing that it's disgusting, much to his horror.

Where's that here?

Okay.

This is a big idea.

I hope you grab this.

If on the left-hand side of the fulcrum is your prospects, and on the right-hand side is you,

obviously, we want to flip the seesaw in your favor. There's two things working against you

in terms of making the sale. Two things on the prospect side which make it hard of you to sell,

and they are, number one, their disbelief, their disbelief, and number two, your price. Would you

agree? They don't believe you, they don't trust you, and man, that's a lot of cash.

And there's two things working for you, you know, two kind of levers that we've been pulling

for years.

And they are, number one, your offer, and number two, our sales ability.

So disbelief, price on one side, offer and sales ability on the other.

I just want you to notice one thing.

I've deliberately put disbelief on the end because I think it weighs heavier than price.

And I've put offer on the end because I think it's more important than sales ability.

So there's this thing that happened that as the price went up, we changed our sales mechanisms.

So if we were selling something for, I don't know, $100, we'd sell it off a page.

That's meant to be a page. Let me redraw it so it looks more pagey.

And if we were selling something for $1,000, then we'd sell it from a webinar.

And if we're selling something for like $10K plus, we'd do a call or we'd run an event.

Would you agree?

Yeah.

That's because we're trying to address both of these problems with the sales ability.

Instead of doing the smart thing, this is what Hutto taught me.

The real needle mover isn't your offer or the sales ability.

The real needle mover is the fulcrum that the whole thing sits on.

And that's your brand.

And so if we can, instead of having these things balanced out, if we can move your brand to this end, then everything's really freaking easy.

So imagine this.

And you are a, whatever city you live in, you're a CrossFit gym owner in that city, right?

And you want to put, get 50 new members this month and you're just like a middle-aged,

in okay body shape, local dude with who nobody knows.

It's going to be really hard for you to get 50 new clients into that thing.

Would you agree?

Right.

But if you are, who's like a current day famous gym bro?

If you're Chris Breen or Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime or Sebum and you go, hey, I'm in my hometown.

I'm going to do a thing for a day.

It's 20 grand.

It's 50 grand.

Come to me for a day.

You'll eat what I eat.

I'll teach you my macros.

We'll lift together and then we'll just jam on your stuff.

That thing will sell out in a nanosecond.

Why?

Because one's got brand and one doesn't.

Does that make sense?

So the big needle mover here is if we can shift your fame in your market, everything else gets

easy. So that's what we've worked on. We've moved brand in this direction. And the most fascinating

thing has happened. Instead of ratcheting up the sales mechanism, we've dropped it all the way back.

Price doesn't matter now because we've attacked disbelief with good brand.

And instead of having to have a call or an event, we don't need to. And instead of having a webinar,

we don't need to.

All we've got is back to the good old days

of here's my stuff on a page.

So we need to do two things today, I think.

Number one, let's get your offer sexy.

And number two, let's figure out

how to move the thing to the side.

Is this landing so far?

Okay, quick chat.

I want to make sure everyone around you

is like on track.

What are you getting?

And what do you need help with?

Quick conversation, go.

Okay, today we've got two jobs.

Job number one, make your offer amazing.

Job number two, move your brand to the left.

You get to decide what you want to do with this sales piece.

Some of you guys are just going to like make your offer amazing,

make the brand really good and keep selling with sales calls

or keep going with the sales team or run workshops and events.

Whatever your style is, is cool with me.

Is that cool?

Do you have to go salesless?

I just want to be really clear.

Is that okay?

Could you?

100% and we'll help you decide what's best for you.

All right.

So I talked about a few of the key pieces.

long form video, short form video has been big for us.

The offer doc has been super great for us.

Changing sales process has been great for us.

Workshops have been great for us.

And one of the challenges with coming to a room like this

is you get like so many great ideas.

It's like you've got all these different pieces

of the jigsaw puzzle and you don't know how they fit together.

And so we spent a little bit of time

and we made you a one page map of the back of the jigsaw box.

So you know what it's meant to look like when it's done.

Okay.

This is a 2025 remix of something that was super useful previously.

It's back a few pages in your book, but it looks like this.

Tell me when you've found that page.

One, one, seven in the Black Belt book.

Bordering book, it'll be a page or two either side.

I would hunch.

One, 14.

Okay.

Let's start at the, it's like the last bit in this section of your book.

Tell me when you're good.

All right.

So this is like the, here's what it could look like when it's done.

Delivery-wise, we're going to sell one of two programs.

When we're on our way to a million dollars a year, we want one core program.

It's either going to be a hero, short course, or it's going to be an MRR, something bigger

and longer.

With me so far?

Great.

To get people to buy that, we need a really great offer.

The tool we use for that is called the Offer Diamond.

By the way, every single thing on this page, none of it is new.

You've got all of these tools.

Okay?

It's all existing tools.

I just want to, like, this is mostly about context and helping you choose.

I'm going to do that right now, and I'm going to ignore that other stuff.

is that cool okay so the offer diamond is how we make the offer sexy we're gonna look at that then

how do we sell it we well we either sell it with a dock or with the appointment engine which is like

a sales call funnel yeah talkie but what about sell by chat yeah cool so much that's amazing and

the end of sell by chat you've got to give them the offer do you make the offer on a call or do

you just send it to them if you're sending it to them it's the dock make sense cool uh so that's

our convert piece. You might want to just circle Hero or MRR. What are you selling right now?

What's your thing? Let's say you circle that one. Boink. Offer Diamond, everyone needs to work on.

Currently, are you selling it by dock or by call? Just circle the one that you're currently doing.

Cool. Then we've got Attract and this Nurture Circle cycle thing in the middle, which is really

Lead Gen, Lead Nurture. Let's go to the far left column, Attract. I reckon there are three core

tools that we use to generate leads. We use short form content as our main platform. For you,

it could be video, could be text, could be graphics, doesn't really matter. If you're getting any kind

of leads from social, short form is the way we do it. Yeah, Tux, but what about ads? Yeah, well,

our strategy is really easy. We post short form content and the ones which do well, we put money

behind. That's the whole thing. You with me so far? Great. I reckon this is a daily. Okay. Every day,

something on short form. It could be something you batch and then share daily, but every day,

I think that's good. Every day gets shared. What do we offer? Well, I think at least once a week,

there's a micromagnet, a little cool thing that somebody can get in return for contact details.

Doesn't have to be. Yeah, I'm about to exactly right. So it doesn't mean you have to make a

new micromagnet every week. We can have a few and just cycle through. Is there anyone here who's

been writing off one good lead magnet for a long, long time? Yeah. Right. So we just have to remember

that at least once a week, we're going to tell people about that thing. And then once a month,

workshop. It could be free. It could be paid. It could be a guest to a client event. It doesn't

really matter. And the systems for each of these pieces, when you look at this map, if you've been

in Black Belt for a little while, can you recognize that these are existing assets? Good. So that's

how we get people in. That's our lead gen piece. Let's zoom into this lead nurture bit. If you're

active in the DMs, we can chat with those leads each day. If you're automating it with ManyChat

or with some new AI tool like these guys do,

that happens every day.

I think every week,

so again, if this is daily,

we're engaging our leads.

Every week, we're sharing a long-form piece of content.

I'm going to put YouTube video there,

but it could be whatever it is for you.

And every week, we create an email campaign

we'll talk about in a minute.

And then this is more of an evergreen.

So this is weekly.

This is more of an evergreen asset,

a video sales letter.

And again, there's tools for all of these things.

So we just get leads in and they go through these pieces.

Who's looking at that and go, okay, that feels pretty clear.

Great.

Who's looking at that and going, oh man, that feels like a lot.

Be honest.

Yeah, of course.

So here's what we did.

We started with one in each column and then added.

So we started with short form content and weekly email to a doc.

And that was kind of our path through.

And then we added, hey, micromagnet.

And then we added workshop.

And then we added YouTube.

And then we added VSL.

And these things just build, but you don't have to have all of them right now.

Is that okay?

Permission to start somewhere.

Is that cool?

Amazing.

Is this useful?

All right.

I just want to give you a little bit of context.

So if back here, we've got two things to work on.

Number one, our offer.

Number two, our brand.

I'd like to make your offer killer right now.

Is that okay?

I mean, we don't have to.

Joe shared yesterday in his breakout a offer auditor, offer optimizer.

It's a great tool.

and we'll share the link to that in the chat if that's cool with you.

Your offer has five core components.

People will say yes if there's enough reward,

and they'll say no if there's too much risk.

These are the five core components.

Hands up if you've heard us talk about the offer diamond before.

Okay, great.

Then I'm talking to you.

If you haven't, this is going to be super great for you.

If you have, I'm really glad you're here.

I don't want to teach it to you.

I want to audit it and make it great.

So the big idea is whether we're going to sell with a call or with a dock,

the offer needs to be able to stand on its own two feet.

In an ideal situation, what we have is your offer is written down somewhere

and you could just like sit down in a room with your perfect prospect.

They walk in.

Nobody's allowed to play and nobody's allowed to say a word.

And the offer is written down and we just like look at them

and we slide it over across the table and they pick it up and they read it

and they're not allowed to say anything either.

We call it the silent offer.

They have to nod their head.

Yep, let's do it or I'm out.

In order for that to work, it's got to be pretty fucking good.

Would you agree?

Yeah.

So let's make it pretty fucking good.

So I'm going to give you the category, give you an example,

and then I just want you to write down on this page what your current offer is.

Is that okay?

And then we'll do silent offer together.

So first thing, if someone's going to buy your program, it starts with promise.

If I do this, what good thing happens to me?

What's the outcome of working with you?

And if it's like, well, we worked together for seven years and eventually gets really good,

That's cool.

But it'd be really nice if something great happened right away as well.

So you might think about this as like three phases.

You know, phase one, phase two, and phase three.

Phase one is like your first week, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days.

Let's call that phase one.

What's the result that happens in phase one, the first onboarding part?

Then phase two, it gets better.

And then phase three gets really, really good.

Does that make sense?

I'm going to give you, by the way, for this activity, I want you to write clearly.

Because in a minute, you're going to slide your offer across the table to someone,

and they're going to read it.

Okay?

What's your current promise?

Think about end result.

And if there is a phase one, phase two, phase three,

get clear about that too.

Can we play some music, please?

Think music.

60 seconds.

Okay.

The promise is the big needle mover on the towards side.

The big needle mover in terms of risk is guarantee,

which is like the promise says,

I'll help you get six pack abs.

And the risk says,

and if you don't get six pack abs,

I'll blank.

Got it?

So what's your current guarantee?

There might be one.

You might have taken a hard-ass approach and gone like, there's no guarantees in life, so work with me.

Right?

I guarantee that if you don't do this, you'll go broke.

That's valid if you've got a strong story behind it.

But how do we make it safe to spend?

This could be a love it or leave it period.

It could be a conditional guarantee.

If you do X, Y, Z, we'll do that.

It could be I'll buy it back off you at full price plus give you $1,000 to work with somebody else.

Could be whatever.

If you don't, I'll blank.

Got it?

You got 60 seconds?

What happens right now guarantee-wise?

Next.

Next on the towards side, bonuses.

In the old days, bonuses were things that you did

just like stack the, you know, make the box heavy.

You get 58 slides, you know, 97 recorded videos,

17 workshops, and we'd like add more stuff.

People don't want more stuff.

If it helps them get the result faster,

easier, or better, I want it in as a bonus.

GPTs are great.

Done with you workshops are great.

Templates are great.

We'll hire you a virtual assistant

who will help you implement the stuff is great.

What can you do that makes it faster, easier, better for them?

What do you currently do?

Ready, set, go.

Okay, next up on the risk removal side, how do we make the payments easier?

So this is, oops, pay plan.

Is it upfront only?

Is there a get started fee and a monthly?

How does your payment situation work through the lens of making it easy to buy?

Is it monthly payments?

Is it weekly payments?

Is there a contract?

Is there no contract?

How does that work in your world?

Nice, next.

So far, we've got this balance.

We've got some things for people to move towards,

and we've removed as much of the risk as we can.

Now we've got these people who are kind of on the fence,

and we need something that gives them a bump

and a reason to do it right now.

This is two things, urgency, limited time,

and scarcity, limited number.

So when we do our Black Belt open-closed,

there's a limited number of spots.

There's 12 places.

Or it's open for four days.

Does that make sense?

So we're always leveraging one or two of those factors.

If that's a thing for you, cool.

if it's not part of your world right now also cool if you don't have this in but you what would like

to how many people could you actually look after if they all joined at the same time like how many

new people could you onboard in a month without you dying you've got built-in scarcity just by

delivery constraint so let's talk about it and use it does that make sense okay so right now you

should have an offer diamond as it currently stands is that true yes okay let's play the silent offer

dun dun dun I wish we had some like spooky music but we don't here's how it's going to work you're

going to get in a group of three uh when it's your turn please listen super carefully pens down eyes

this way I want you to get this I only want to say it once uh we're going to play silent offer

you're going to be doing this in a group of three each person's going to have a go of being the

offer producer and the other two get to read it and nod I'm in or shake I'm out you got it

so what you're going to do is you're going to start by telling them who they are like you're a

chiropractor, what kind of person it is, what kind of problem they've got, and what their goals are.

You're a chiropractor, you don't have enough patience, and you're stressed out because there's

enough time, and you'd really like to grow without it killing your life. 10 seconds. With that said,

then you're just going to take your offer diamond, and you're going to slide it towards the other

guys, and they're going to have a read. This is a 60-second process. Explain it, 10 seconds. They

can read it and scan it, just based on what they see, and that's it. Then, they're going to have

a minute and a half to give you,

have you thought about this didn't speak to me?

What about this?

And brainstorm ideas.

Does that make sense?

You can take notes on the very next page

of their feedback

and then ideas for your offer

and then switch to person two

and then switch to person three.

You got it?

You have eight minutes,

nine minutes for this whole thing

for the three of you guys to have a go.

Ready, set, go.

So your group gave you some feedback.

Who got a...

Hands up if you've got a...

Who got a...

Who was like a...

Did anyone get a...

Okay, so hopefully you got some feedback that's useful for you.

On the next page, this one here, I just want you to go, let's capture down,

what do they say that might be useful?

I'm going to give you 60 seconds right now to go, okay, they said my guarantee sucked,

my pricing was weird, and they didn't like my breath.

By the way, 50 cent TikTok, if you sell in person, that's the best sales objection killer

you could probably get.

I'll give you 60 seconds right now.

What are the tweaks and the upgrades?

So do you know some upgrades you can make to your offer?

Yes or no?

Right.

So I said we had two jobs.

The first was to make your offer more good.

I'd say we could tick that box.

The next is how do we move the brand to the left so that selling becomes easy?

I think a lot of us get hung up on, oh man, I'm just getting a lot of pushback on price.

You're getting pushback on price because of this.

We took our Offer Diamond and we put it into a simple two-page doc.

You guys have all seen it.

It's in the Offer Chassis Training.

The Offer Doc doesn't even have to be great.

Dan Martell, who I love, has the world's worst Offer Doc.

Who's seen the Offer Doc for Elite?

Yeah, it's atrocious.

I've literally got it as a text message that I refer to about once a month,

just to like giggle at how bad it is.

But here's the thing,

the doc doesn't need to be good.

Remember, we like,

we can drop that thing,

the sales mechanism down

because brand is so strong.

Whether you're selling on a call

or with a doc,

the real leverage,

the real magic is going to be

in this bit here, the brand.

So if we can chat about that,

I'd be super stoked.

We're going to sell with a doc

or even if you're using a sales call,

let's make sure everyone on the sales team

knows their offer inside and out.

Okay.

I said there was a doc, which we've talked about.

There's demand and a deadline.

I'm going to talk about demand first.

We're really doing this little stack here.

Okay?

Every day, we're posting a short video on socials.

What do I use?

Same tools we gave you guys on the first day with Ken.

These little bandwidth cards.

Each card has a hook, room for a hook,

something to keep the wheel in, a story, a list, or some steps,

and then a payoff and a CTA.

BoardDreamers, you can get these.

Suckers.

I'll give you some in the next session.

Is that cool?

This is like a little short form,

a little thing to outline your short form videos.

When I shoot vids, if I'm with Sean,

we just have a list of these cards that we ripped through.

If I'm out solo, I just have the cards in my right pocket

and I've got my phone.

I just put one out and I read the back

and I shoot the thing.

And when I'm done, I put in my left card

and my left pocket and it's done.

And then I do the next card.

It's a very scientific method.

That's how we do it.

Okay.

It's the two-pocket video production engine, we call it.

TM.

It's up to you.

If you hold your phone here, I find that pulling out of the pocket is easy,

but that's just awkward.

So I go right to left.

Just, you're welcome.

You're welcome.

This is deep.

So daily short form.

There's an amazing training called the 80-20 content system,

which outlines this whole process.

There's four questions your prospects have.

four questions your content has to answer.

Do I like you? Do you have a plan?

Does it work? How do I get started?

So there's four kinds of content we shoot.

They're the four colors of the cards.

Do I like you is answered with character content.

Tell them your backstory like you're a superhero.

I got bitten by a radioactive spider.

That's why I'm so great right now. Tell them about your day.

Like day in the life. Great for stories.

And tell them what you're working on. Show them what you're working on.

So connection.

Value is next.

This answer is like, do you have a plan?

Teach them why, what, and how your stuff works.

that's these red cards third question will it work for me proof that's these green cards

screenshots of clients results testimonials case studies are my favorite and again each one of

these just has like the category and the training shows you how to do it and then do i like you can

you help me will it work for me what's the next step blue cards invitation cards we're going to

invite them to a magnet or an event like a workshop or to work with you direct and that's our content

plan. Does that make sense? Again, all of this in the portal ready for you. Today, I really want to

connect some dots rather than teach you new marketing. So we do that each week. We offer a

micromagnet, usually like a comment below to get. And then once a month, we run a workshop. If you

search for any of these terms, you will find the appropriate training. With workshops, we've got a

few different styles we do. We do paid workshops. We've done free workshops. One called the workshop

that doesn't matter. Your best prospects are busy. They're probably the ones who are registered,

but not show up

and they're the ones you actually want.

So we offer them a sales call

on the thank you page

if we're selling that way.

That's called the workshop.

It doesn't matter.

There's training for that.

We do guest pass to client event.

If you're running workshops

with your clients once a month,

you could invite prospects to that,

have them pay a hundred bucks

or 50 bucks or whatever it is to come.

And there's trainings

for all of those things.

So once a month we run a workshop.

That's that plus long form video,

which is new for us.

That's our whole brand with peace.

And our job is just to get people

to spend more time on our brand.

And that takes care

of the disbelief part of the fulcrum.

Are you tracking so far?

Hands up if this is making sense.

Yeah, great.

The next piece that's really,

that's the demand piece.

The bit in the middle, the deadline,

is really where email fits for us.

Again, there's trainings for this.

Let me give you the high-level overview.

How many products, programs do you have?

If you're under a million bucks a year,

the answer should be one.

If you're over, you can do what the hell you like.

So if you take a month,

an average month has four weeks.

How many weeks?

You guys are smart.

Average month has four weeks, and we just cycle through,

like we've got a bigger business with more products and programs.

So for us, we've got a disadvantage.

I've got to sell.

One week, I've got to promote the little thing for the babies.

A week later, I've got to promote the big thing for the gangsters.

And in the middle, like that, don't do that.

You can avoid it.

So one week a month, we promote your flagship offer.

And it's open for a week, and then it closes at the end of the week.

I don't care if it's evergreen, if people can buy any time,

but once a week, we're going to highlight it.

I've got this many spots right now.

And when the four spots are gone

or the 12 spots are gone

or the Friday comes up,

it's closed.

Is that cool?

So one week, an open close.

Another week, a workshop.

The other two weeks,

if that's like the core things

we're promoting, that's great.

The other weeks just do business as usual.

I call it club random

where I get to write about

whatever the hell I want to write about.

It's my favorite week,

to be super honest.

It's very fun.

And if you've got a business

with more offers,

we'll do a workshop one week,

boardroom a week,

bike build a week,

clients a week.

That's how we do that.

Does that make sense?

We just want an offer cadence,

and each one of these has a deadline.

We write five emails.

Can you write these down?

Across a week.

By the way, if you currently email daily, steal this.

If you email twice a week right now,

keep you twice a week,

and then maybe add one more,

and just add as you go,

whatever you feel comfortable with.

These are the five that we send.

Usually starts with an announcement.

Hey, I'm doing this thing.

I'm running a workshop this week about this.

Here's the details.

Come join us.

Or, hey, I just had three spots open up this week in Black Belt.

You can read the details here.

It's short.

Here's the thing.

Then around that offer, we have four more emails.

A problem email, which is about the pain they've got right now.

If you don't fix this, this bad thing will happen.

You should fix it.

Buy my thing.

A proof email.

Meet Bob.

Bob had this problem, just like we talked about yesterday.

Bob joined me.

It got really good.

Be like Bob.

Click this link.

We've got a problem email.

We've got a proof email.

Third, we've got a philosophy email.

They all start with P.

philosophy email this is like how you remember when caleb the other day talked about most people

believe this industry like industry the rest of the industry says this but i believe that instead

it's that so around your topic uh take something that you believe that most people don't that your

prospects get wrong and just teach them most people believe this it's done because of this reason if

you believe that this bad thing happens instead think about it like this and do that and it'll be

great that's what we're doing this week buy my stuff fourth email this is the plan the plan hey

I'm about to work with a group of people,

and in the first few weeks, we're going to do these three things.

First, we'll do that.

Then we'll do this.

Then we'll do this other thing.

Does that make sense?

An announcement, a problem, a proof, a philosophy, and a plan.

I'm just giving you the high level because the eye level is in the portal already.

Is that okay?

You guys have gotten really quiet, and it's freaking me out.

What's that training called?

It's great.

It's the one training that doesn't have a cool name.

It's called Stop Posting Content, Do This Instead.

Okay.

But one final piece that I want to draw attention to, like make you aware of here.

If you think about attract, convert, deliver, you've really got three kinds of people in

your audience.

You've got cold, skeptical leads.

And really, this is like, who are you, right?

Cold, skeptical leads.

Then we've got warm, curious prospects.

And then we've got hot, primed buyers.

And our job is to do the things on the left for the cold people and get them into your

world.

Do the things in the middle for the warm people to microwave them up.

And then the offer diamond gets them to go from here to there.

Does that make sense?

We've gone salesless in the last six months and I'm never going to go back.

This is just too fun.

For a dopamine addicted creative who likes to like do something, hit send and watch the

like just like conjure clients out of the ether.

It's amazing.

Whether you do sales calls or salesless, I don't mind.

what I definitely know is that this left-hand side of this page is going to be crazy, crazy helpful

for you. So what I'd love you to do is grab a capture card or two and go, okay, oh, actually,

I had to do the thing before that. I reminded myself. So I didn't make a mess. Let's make this

really tactical and practical. Last page in the section in your book. Like we've just looked at

that. It's the very next page. It looks like this. It's called My System. Tell me when you're there.

Okay. This is the same graphic we just did plus an action plan below. What I want you to do is

is three things. First, I want you to look at this list and go, what am I not going to do?

So my answer would be, like if I'm selling BlackBot, I'm not going to sell a hero. Oops,

crossed that out, different color. I'm not going to do hero and I'm not going to do sales calls

and I'm not going to do shout. That's me. Cool. Job one, what am I not going to do? Job two,

what have I already got now? And so you can either mark in a color or just like list the bit that

you're already doing. Hey, I'm doing short form. What's going on with my freaking pen, man?

Okay, step one, what am I not going to do?

Step two, what I've already got now, like what's good?

Then what from this would I add next?

And then what could I do later?

Make yourself a plan.

Does that make sense?

Just like we started with short form

and then later we added micromagnets

and later we added workshops.

You don't have to do everything.

I just want you to make the, I'm not doing that.

I've already got this bit and that's my next piece.

I'm going to give you 90 seconds here

to make your now, next, later list.

Ready, set, go.

All right, so we started this journey talking about,

We were sales heavy because we were marketing light.

Why were we marketing light?

Well, frankly, because remember in the State of the Union on day one,

I said that back in the old days, the job was like repurpose stuff.

Yeah, I was just being lazy.

Not just like, well, I was two kinds of lazy.

Strategy lazy?

Let's just take the stuff I've done and like slice it up and share it out.

And secondly, because business was like heavy,

I was like pretty mojo-less and in a bit of a funk.

And it's really hard to be your entertaining best

or even sometimes show up to the video shoot

when you feel a bit lame.

And so just like the sales team was working hard,

the marketing team was working hard,

the bottleneck always was me.

So the changes to business model have changed mojo

and now I'm like alive and excited

about shooting the content again.

And because I'm showing up differently,

the marketing can do its job

and the sales doesn't have to.

Has this been useful?

Amazing.

I would love to do two things

and then in four minutes,

We're going to bounce for a break.

The first thing is, I'd love to know what popped or landed for you from this conversation.

I'm going to chuck around the catch box and catch a thought.

And then as we do that, if you've got an idea that's useful for you, it goes on a card,

capture card.

Is that cool?

So from this conversation, what landed for you?

What popped?

What's an insight?

An aha or a, oh, I could do that.

All right.

Everyone else?

I love and appreciate the hell out of you.

I'm sorry we went a little bit long on this session.

I wanted to share it.

Hopefully it's been useful.
