# Saleless Coach - How It Works

## The One-Sentence Version

Your AI assistant for answering any question about the Salesless Experiment - Ed's framework for selling high-ticket coaching without sales calls.

## Why This Exists

BlackBelt coaches often have questions about the Salesless training after the intensive. They might remember the concept but forget the specifics. This skill acts like having the training transcript searchable and summarized on demand.

Think of it like having a study buddy who took really good notes on the Mexico Intensive session.

## The Problem It Solves

After a live event, coaches go home excited but fuzzy on details:
- "What were the five parts of the Offer Diamond again?"
- "How does the weekly email thing work?"
- "What's that fulcrum model Hutto made?"

Instead of digging through recordings or workbooks, they can just ask.

## How You Use It

Just ask questions about Salesless naturally:

**Examples:**
- "Walk me through the Context Fulcrum"
- "What's the difference between the Doc and the Offer Diamond?"
- "How do I know if I should go salesless or keep my sales calls?"
- "What are the five emails in the weekly campaign?"
- "Remind me about the 80-20 content types"

The skill will pull from Ed's actual training transcript to give accurate answers.

## The Core Frameworks (Quick Reference)

**Doc, Demand, Deadline** - The three things that make Salesless work:
1. An offer doc that can sell without you
2. Marketing that creates demand and warms people up
3. Weekly campaigns with a reason to act now

**Context Fulcrum** - Brand is the lever that makes everything easier. Strong brand = can sell from a simple page. Weak brand = need calls, webinars, events.

**Offer Diamond** - The five pieces of a compelling offer: Promise, Guarantee, Bonuses, Pay Plan, Urgency/Scarcity.

**The System 2025** - The full map: Attract → Nurture → Convert → Deliver.

## What It Won't Do

- It won't tell you "you should definitely go salesless" - that's a personal choice based on what lights you up
- It won't replace the actual training - for the full experience, watch the recording
- It won't write your offer doc for you - but it will explain what goes in one
