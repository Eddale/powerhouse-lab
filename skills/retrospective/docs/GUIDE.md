# Retrospective - How It Works

## The One-Sentence Version

It's your weekly Done column review - like clearing your desk on Friday, but with questions that help you learn from what happened.

## Why This Exists

You have skills for looking forward (win-the-day) and managing the present (task-clarity-scanner), but nothing for looking back. Without reflection, you repeat the same patterns. The retrospective closes the feedback loop.

Think of it like a campaign post-mortem. After a launch, you ask: What worked? What didn't? What do we do differently next time? Same thing here, but weekly.

## How You Use It

Say "weekly review" or "run retrospective" whenever you want to reflect on the past week. No specific day required - run it when it feels right.

The skill does the grunt work automatically:
- Scans your last 7 daily notes
- Counts what you shipped
- Shows you the numbers

Then it asks four simple questions:
1. **What flowed?** (Energy givers)
2. **What stuck?** (Energy drains)
3. **What patterns?** (Recurring themes)
4. **One change?** (Next week's experiment)

The last question is the important one. One specific change, not a transformation plan.

## The Output

Everything gets saved to a Retrospective doc in your Zettelkasten. Searchable, linkable, builds history over time. You can look back at six months of retrospectives and see patterns you'd never notice week-to-week.

## The Philosophy

This is Jim Benson's Personal Kanban retrospective (clear the Done column, learn from it) combined with Scrum's Plus/Delta format (what worked, what to change). Simple, fast, actionable.

The goal isn't a therapy session. It's 10-15 minutes of honest reflection that produces one concrete change.
