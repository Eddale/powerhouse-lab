# Retrospective - Roadmap

## Shipped

| Version | Date | What Changed |
|---------|------|--------------|
| v1.0 | 2026-01-11 | Initial release - weekly retrospective with Done scanning and reflection questions |

## Planned

- [ ] **Monthly mode** - Circuit breaker decisions, betting table format
- [ ] **Quarterly mode** - Strategic review, goals alignment check
- [ ] **Annual mode** - Energy calendar, full year goals audit

## Ideas (Not Committed)

- Automatic pattern detection (surface items that appear in Ready across multiple weeks)
- Week-over-week comparison (this week vs. last week)
- Integration with morning-metrics for output tracking
- "One Change" auto-creates task in next Monday's Ready section
- Streak tracking (consecutive weeks with retrospectives)
- Export to summary format for coaching calls
