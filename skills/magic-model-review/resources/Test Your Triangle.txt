00:00
Alright, Muchacho.

00:02
Good job you.

00:03
Super proud.

00:04
You're doing the thinking work.

00:05
The thinking work is hard, but you're doing it.

00:06
So in this session, what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the triangle we've built together.

00:11
Let's be honest.

00:12
I was just the guide on the side.

00:14
You did all the work.

00:14
You deserve all the credit.

00:16
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna test it to make sure it's great, and then we're gonna work on naming your blues, your modules

00:24
So that they are like, oh, I want that and oh I'd love to get started on it.

00:29
Cool.

00:30
So uh

00:32
When it comes to a triangle, kind of any model really, but particularly for a triangle, we're looking for symmetry.

00:37
And I'm talking about visual symmetry, like the things look the same.

00:42
Two here, four there, one here.

00:44
That's not that's not symmetry.

00:45
But we're also looking for language symmetry.

00:48
So it wants to be simple and it wants to be elegant.

00:51
So what I'd love to do is just walk you through each of the key pieces and just give you one, maybe two questions to ask about each one.

00:57
And if there's any which are like hell yes, you know when there's one that's a hell yes, but like good, can move on, or if it's good enough, and we can sharpen it up in a coaching call together.

01:06
Uh and if there are any that feel like, oh, I probably need to go back and work on that.

01:10
I'm just gonna say circle it, spend five minutes, come up with three or four options, pick the best one.

01:15
Please don't obsess about this.

01:16
This is not a one-month project.

01:19
Um, you know, it's it's from here if there's like 30 minutes of thinking work to get you good enough to launch, I'm good with that.

01:26
Is that alright?

01:27
So uh

01:31
We're gonna work on goal for each one and just like this is just a logic check.

01:34
Yes, it ticks that box.

01:36
Number two, we're gonna look at symmetry, and then we're gonna look at language symmetry, the most important, the most important one once we've got like the right number of stuff in the right number of places.

01:43
We're looking at you know

01:45
If you've got like six words for one and one word for the other, yeah, it feels a bit out of balance, right?

01:49
Two or three words for each and we're golden.

01:51
All right.

01:51
And then we'll look at how do we how do we name them?

01:53
Going to teach you this epic.

01:54
tool so enough about that let's chat a little bit i think i mentioned in the last video starbucks um tall grande venti or

02:06
I'm not American and I don't drink Starbucks, so I might have the order wrong.

02:10
But there's all sorts of things which are wrong with that.

02:11
Like if you go to a clothing stop and they're a clothing store and they've got like a small, a medium, and a and a Fatso

02:18
The names are all off, dude.

02:20
And so we we want the names to to be the same all the way around.

02:24
And so that's that's how got that.

02:25
They just want to like fit together.

02:26
I don't know if you watched Sesame Street as a kid.

02:29
I did.

02:29
And uh my favorite part of Sesame Street was they'd have like

02:32
I think it was like four kids in four corners of like four little four different videos and it would say one of these kids is not like the other one of these kids is not the same now it's time to play our game

02:41
And then it'll be like three kids bouncing a ball and one sitting down in the corner.

02:44
Well it's obviously the kid sitting in the corner is the odd one out.

02:46
We just want to look, hey, is there any odd one outs here that we need to fix together?

02:50
Right?

02:51
So uh let's do it.

02:53
Let's start with your yellow.

02:56
Yellow is your goal, and uh the goal wants to be incredibly in fact all of them want to be

03:02
clear and emotionally right.

03:04
So when you think about a goal, it wants to be clear, like it's a measurable.

03:07
I can point to it.

03:08
$10,000 a month.

03:10
That's a clear goal.

03:11
Lifestyle empire.

03:12
Not as clear.

03:13
But it it's aspirational.

03:14
We want something that is clear and has some emotion attached to it.

03:17
So when you think about your your yellow, your goal, is it really clear?

03:22
Or is it a bit vague?

03:24
I'll give you an example.

03:25
Like sometimes people will write on one of their greens, clarity.

03:29
I mean clarity is cool, but clarity about what?

03:32
Okay?

03:33
Clarity is cool, but clarity about what?

03:35
The moment you go like um if it's about vision, clear vision, okay, I know what that is and I want one

03:41
But if it's just clarity, not as not as good.

03:44
Okay?

03:44
So uh that's the big one here.

03:46
Is it clear and emotional?

03:50
Let's just kind of, oops.

03:52
Let's pop that down as the as the test.

03:56
Is it clear?

03:58
Do I want it?

04:00
And is there some feeling attached?

04:05
Cool.

04:06
Now we've reverse engineered our reds, but every time we deliver it, obviously, like I said, we're gonna deliver it from the middle out.

04:13
So let's look at our reds next.

04:15
When somebody says, oh, I really love this, the yellow goal, there's a part of our brain which goes, yeah, but I can't because insert reasons here.

04:25
Here's the check.

04:26
Do the three reasons you've mapped out, your three reds, do they feel uh firstly, do they feel real?

04:34
Are they accurate and is there like usually I have like one word like leads and a word which um feels a bit uncomfortable.

04:43
It doesn't have to be like a smash in the face.

04:46
But like if I've got poor lead flow, okay, that yeah, that's accurate.

04:51
Like it hurts a little bit, but not I want to be able to go, yeah, yeah, that's me.

04:55
And I feel a bit embarrassed about it, but I don't want to feel like

04:58
Oh, how do they know?

04:59
Right?

04:59
It's like, yeah, they're talking to me.

05:01
Our sales one for our clients program is awkward sales, like awkward sales conversations.

05:05
Yeah, that's like sales conversations is the topic and there's a word in front.

05:10
Delivery fear.

05:11
Like fear that um I'm not even sure if this thing will really get people the results I'm kind of promising.

05:17
That feels uncomfortable.

05:18
And if it works really, really well, I don't even know that I can coach 50 or 100 people without dying.

05:24
Right?

05:25
The wheels might fall off.

05:26
So that's the that's what we're looking for here.

05:28
Is there a topic?

05:30
Word and a feeling word or a describing word that people don't love.

05:35
By the way, I grew up in Melbourne.

05:36
We did grammar

05:38
like verbs, nouns and adjectives for one day and I was super distracted that day.

05:42
We're in a new new building 'cause our building burnt down and I didn't I'm not really sure what an adjective is yet.

05:47
But so like a describing word is what I'm trying to say.

05:49
I think that's a is that no it doesn't matter.

05:53
So for our our reds, what I'm really looking for is is two things and it doesn't matter which order we need like a topic word like sales or

06:03
leads or delivery and then a a descriptive word which is like it's got a little bit of an ick to it like a feeling that I don't want and it could be feeling topic or it could be topic feeling it doesn't matter.

06:15
So for these are usually like two words for each.

06:18
You can do three if it if it really makes sense, but if you do three, you've got to do three everywhere because of symmetry, baby.

06:24
Okay.

06:25
So check yours.

06:27
We're either good or we've got some tweaking to do.

06:29
Topic word and a feeling word, and we're gonna be great.

06:31
Let's go to our greens.

06:33
Greens is kind of the same thing.

06:34
In fact, these are these two are mirror images of each other.

06:37
So these can be two words or three words, so long as all of the greens are the same number of words.

06:42
I'm super stoked with that.

06:43
And again, usually we've got a topic word and a feeling that feels great.

06:48
Okay?

06:49
A happy feeling word.

06:52
So our sales one was awkward sales.

06:56
What do they want instead?

06:57
They want effortless conversions.

06:59
Why do they choose conversion, not sales?

07:01
Because it's just a different word to say the same thing.

07:03
It makes the model feels have a little bit more variety.

07:05
So that's that's

07:06
That's a bonus tip for you as well.

07:09
So we want topic and feeling for each of those, and they want to point to an outcome.

07:13
Okay?

07:14
So you can either do topic and feeling word, effortless sales, or you can do a specific result like leads every day.

07:20
clients every week both of those will really really work okay um I think that's our greens so all you want to do is you want to do a test on your greens

07:34
Is there a clear outcome I can point to or a topic and a feeling?

07:38
Then the blues.

07:40
First test for the blues is the little test I mentioned at the end of the last video.

07:45
If I do these three th these two things or these three things, do I get the green?

07:51
One plus two, yeah.

07:53
Maybe three should equal green.

07:55
Blue, blue, blue should equal green.

07:57
And so then the question is, hey, is there anything in here that I put in that I don't need?

08:00
If there is, let's just rip it out.

08:02
Uh less is better

08:03
And if it's possible that I do blue and blue and blue and I still don't get my green, something's missing.

08:09
And we just want to play with those until it's a clear one plus one plus one equals three.

08:13
You know, blue plus blue plus blue equals

08:15
it was equals green.

08:16
Cool.

08:17
Um so that's the first test.

08:20
What I'd suggest you do is to pause this video and if you haven't already, just kind of given these a little score as we go around and what I'd love to do is teach you an amazing tool.

08:28
that we use in Black Belt all the time.

08:29
In fact, internally we use this probably two or three times a week.

08:34
It's an amazing tool called the product handle and it's how we name our stuff and it's a great way to name your blues so they sound like something cool.

08:42
My rule for projects and modules is ideally they want to sound like a thing.

08:48
So much like a thing that it sounds like the sort of thing that Batman would would strap to his utility belt to get a job done, right?

08:54
Because the magic in this is it's like it's not this massive skill you need to learn or it's not there's nothing wrong with you.

08:59
If you have this tool, life gets easy, right?

09:01
It's like when you start a new sport, you obviously you want to get the gear.

09:04
This is like the gear for your outcome

09:06
Okay, so this is a tool called the product handle.

09:10
It's called a product handle because a handle is like on Instagram, handle is your name, and a product is each of the things that you build, market and sell.

09:20
And so it's a cutter product handle because this is the way we name our stirf.

09:23
Cool?

09:24
Uh so it's a great tool and we use it.

09:27
Literally everything every new thing that we make, we run it through this filter.

09:31
And uh once you've done it a few times, it'll come second nature.

09:33
It's a great tool for getting started on naming things.

09:35
So, what I want you to do is just take one of your blue modules

09:40
Maybe the first one on the yeah actually the first one whichever one for me I'd probably go top left but you can start any anywhere you want I'm just gonna I'm gonna do this little activity together

09:52
I'm going to teach it to you and then you can use this tool anytime you want.

09:55
So basically it goes like this.

09:59
We start here.

10:00
Whoops.

10:01
Start here and we're looking for a combination of two words, a keyword and a technical word, and we're just going to play with them a little bit until we get one that really sings.

10:09
So keyword

10:12
We're going to ask what's what what is this thing?

10:15
So let's say you've built something and it's about delegation.

10:17
Just do a couple of sentences about what it is.

10:20
It's a tool to help you delegate

10:25
Faster with your team.

10:30
And maybe it delegates projects.

10:32
Okay, so there's some keywords already.

10:34
How are people better off when they use it?

10:36
Well, you get

10:38
Uh less dropped balls.

10:43
People are really clear uh about the job

10:49
To be done.

10:52
And that'll do.

10:54
And then third, what's it like?

10:55
This is optional.

10:56
I I sometimes use it.

10:58
What's it like?

10:58
It's like a it's like a

11:03
A scorecard.

11:08
Um actually it's it's less like a scorecard, it's more like a

11:12
a script for an actor.

11:14
Go on, read these lines.

11:15
Okay?

11:15
It's like a it's like a script.

11:17
Okay, cool.

11:17
So what we're gonna do is then we're just gonna highlight or circle your choice

11:21
some keywords and so let's say obviously deleg delegate or delegation is a is a keyword here um maybe it's for projects

11:33
Or you could go jobs to be done.

11:34
Okay, so there's three.

11:36
So we've got three.

11:37
That's what we're looking for.

11:38
Three keywords from the left.

11:39
Next we've got.

11:41
Uh technical words.

11:44
I've just got a list of cool cool things you can put at the end of something to make it sound like a thing, right?

11:48
So we've got an advantage analysis approach, audit blueprint.

11:52
Booster, cheat sheet, builder, checklist, expander, focuser.

11:57
You get the idea.

11:58
It's a bunch of cool words.

11:58
So I'm just gonna scroll through and for this delegation thing which doesn't exist, I'm just making it up

12:02
What what feels like it could be a thing?

12:04
Well it could be a builder, like a delegation builder thing.

12:10
It could be a method.

12:16
It could be a snapshot.

12:19
That'll do.

12:20
Just pick two or three or four.

12:22
And then all we're going to do is going to write our keywords on the on this column right here

12:26
So we've got uh what did I say?

12:28
It was a snapshot, I think I said.

12:30
So we've got delegation, um, projects

12:38
And what did I say?

12:39
Jobs to be done.

12:40
Jobs to be done.

12:44
Cool.

12:45
And now three technical words.

12:46
We had builder.

12:48
We had method and we have snapshot.

12:54
Okay, so now we're just gonna play with these and see what sounds what sounds good.

12:59
And move me over there so you can see.

13:02
So let's just try them.

13:03
Imagine we've got the word the at the start of each of these.

13:05
The delegation builder.

13:10
That sounds okay.

13:12
Delegation better sounds okay, doesn't sound amazing to me.

13:14
So it's probably not that.

13:15
The delegation method.

13:16
Okay, well that sounds more solid.

13:18
The delegation snapshot.

13:20
I kind of like

13:21
It's like a snapshot of here.

13:22
I'm going to delegate this thing and just go like here's the picture of what it looks like when it's done.

13:25
I kind of like that.

13:25
So right now, that feels like it's got promise.

13:28
The project builder, the project method, the project snapshot.

13:31
Project snapshot I think could work.

13:34
Oops.

13:36
So that's that's an option.

13:39
The job to be done method.

13:40
A job to be done builder.

13:42
I don't like job to be done method.

13:44
I quite like job to be on snapshot.

13:46
I don't like as much.

13:47
So we've either got this one here or we've got the delegation snapshot, I think we called it.

13:54
Okay, so we've got three names which frankly any of them could work.

13:58
So we're just gonna pick the one that we like the best.

13:59
I like the project snapshot.

14:02
So final version.

14:05
Uh the project whoops

14:13
snapshot and now we've got a name for our our blue right here so imagine on as we explain in this model we've got this thing called the

14:24
What do they call it?

14:25
Project snapshot?

14:29
Or the delegation snapshot, whatever I said.

14:30
What do they say?

14:33
I said both.

14:34
Let's call it the project snapshot.

14:36
Okay, so that's the name of a cool tool.

14:40
And so all I want you to do for your blues, for each blue, you've got an idea, go through the process, you know what to do.

14:48
What is it?

14:49
How are people better off?

14:50
Maybe it's there's a metaphor.

14:52
Pick the top three keywords that make sense to you.

14:54
Look through the technical words list, pick a couple off, and come up with a name.

14:57
For each one you'll put the final

14:59
version and then add it to your blue like I just did here.

15:03
Remember we're looking for does it sound cool?

15:06
Like does it make the quest worthy and do I want to do it?

15:08
If that's the case, like if it's if it's clear and kind of desirable, we're winning at life.

15:12
All right.

15:13
So uh that's the game.

15:15
We've got a good idea for our triangle.

15:18
We want um symmetry of number.

15:21
Want symmetry in terms of number of words and then symmetry in terms of names that map together.

15:28
Okay

15:29
So project snapshot the delegation filter we could have used.

15:32
These are all good names.

15:33
I want you to come up with six for your blues or nine for your blues if you've got three around each.

15:39
And then on the next coaching call, just say hey.

15:41
Or if you've got access to the Facebook group, drop it in going, hey, I've been working on my blues.

15:44
What do you think of these?

15:45
And people will ask you some questions, give you some feedback.

15:47
Is that cool?

15:48
I think we've done good work here.

15:50
By the way, this is the last video in our Design Your Triangle series.

15:54
And if you've been following along and doing the work as we go, you've got a pretty good triangle and you are miles ahead of

16:00
Kind of everybody else in your space who's still trying to give people a big fat list and tell you tell them all of the features and benefits.

16:05
We've got a great story.

16:06
You know, this is the result I want for you.

16:09
Here's why it matters.

16:11
Then in red, there's three things which are holding you back.

16:14
You know, this one gets in the way.

16:17
This one slows you down.

16:18
This one stops you from getting what you want.

16:20
Oh man.

16:21
Instead of those three things, what we want to work on together is to get you this green and that green and this green milestone as well.

16:27
That sounds good.

16:28
How the hell do I do that?

16:28
Well, we work on these things, including our brand new project.

16:32
snapshot or whatever yours are.

16:34
Cool.

16:34
So all I'd love you to do, take these and get them done.

16:38
This um

16:40
Little video series has been an example of what one of your modules look might look like.

16:43
You know, three or five, four or six or whatever it is.

16:47
Little short videos, seven to fifteen minutes, maybe twenty minutes tops.

16:50
This one's 17 and a bit.

16:53
to show people step by step how to do your stuff.

16:55
And if there's an update to do, we can record a little plugin we call them a satellite around it later

17:01
So I don't want you to record any of the content yet.

17:04
Just get a triangle that we can work with together.

17:07
All right.

17:07
Big love.

17:08
This has been really fun.

17:09
Well done you.

17:09
Take good care.

17:10
I'll see you soon.
