Alright, let's have some fun. In this series of videos, we're gonna show you a Swiss Army knife tool. One simple triangle model we're gonna design together over the next few videos. That will help you market better. It'll help you sell significantly easier. And it's gonna make delivery really simple, really effective for your coaching clients. Okay, so uh it's got a triangle model. In this first video, I want to show you what it is and how we use it for marketing, sales, and delivery. And then over the next few videos, we're just going to build it out step by step together. Okay, so you got I got you, you got me, I'm gonna do this Piece by piece together, um have some fun. So let's talk about what happens if you don't have this piece right. Uh Let's talk about three problems. Number one, on the marketing side of things, if you're not careful, you sound the same as everybody else, right? Every every you know in your industry, there's a bunch of people doing the same sort of stuff, making the same sort of promises. This gives you a really clear way to stand out. If you don't have it though, you look the same as everyone else. Number two, in a sales conversation, prospects are pretty low on trust and confidence And so you end up losing a bunch of deals that you should have got because you're awesome. They just don't see it yet and they don't have what we call conversion confidence. And number three, when it comes to delivering stuff to clients, Sometimes our delivery is too complicated. People get lost, people get overwhelmed, and they lose track even though they think the stuff is good. Okay, so if we do this right though, here's what happens instead. From a marketing point of view, we're not just making promises like everyone else, but we're actually sh proving it by by um painting the journey of here's where you are and here's where you want to go, these are the obstacles in the way, here are the milestone goals and here's the plan. People love a plan. So we get to enroll people in a in a journey and they get to be the hero in the story with you as their guide on the side. On the sales side of things, instead of people losing confidence, we install what we call conversion confidence. It's the feeling that a prospect needs to have to feel comfortable and confident to take the next step with you. Okay? This is gonna be like, oh I like the plan. I can see what we're going to work on. I've got problems in those areas and you've got a plan for me. I'm in. Okay? We can use it as a diagnostic. And number three, from a delivery point of view, it gives people a really simple pathway. Both a focus on what they're what they should work on right now and secondly um a vision for where we you know what that the whole journey looks like So there's a couple of mistakes people make when it comes to um comes to these visual models. First one is they don't have one and they're just winging it and making stuff up. Not great. Secondly, they give people a lot of content in their program but no context. And if it's all content, people get lost and overwhelmed really, really easily. Way easier than I wish they did, but it's true. Number two. The the model has no journey to it and so this has got a the progression we're about to build out together gives people a really clear here's where we're at, here's what's in the way, here's where we're gonna get to and here's how we're gonna do it. And it just gives people a ton of confidence. This one might be a bit. I think you'll probably bump into this over the next few few videos, but you might not have this problem yet. is when they design a visual model, whether it's a a genius model, kind of three-circle van, or it's a triangle model like we're going to build today, symmetry really matters. And so we're going to be balancing language palette. Um you think about you go to a coffee shop, you can have a small, a medium, or a large. We go to Starbucks, there's a a tall, a venti, and a grande. Like it should be You know, short, medium, and tall. Should be uh small, medium, large. If there's a venti, which is you get the idea. The words need to fit together. And then secondly, visually it's got to look the same, same number of words in each one, same number of projects around the outside. You'll see what I mean. When when these models are done well, they're elegant. Okay, simple, elegant, clear. So with that as a bit of a setup, let's come over here. I want to explain what the model is about. I'm gonna show you uh visually what it looks like that we're gonna build together and then I'll show you how to use it. Is that alright? Let's uh let's jump over here. So uh making sure yep we're good. So this is our visual model. It's called the triangle model because at its heart there's a triangle. It's got three sides. Rather than give you all the details right now, I'm just going to show you what the component pieces are and the order that we tell the story. It's going to start up with a goal. Specifically The big result that your program is designed to get people. So they know they're not just buying a course, they're buying an outcome. There's a a product in the States called Five Hour Energy. It's a little bottle of energy goop, right? You're not buying an energy drink, you're buying five hours of energy. So your program should be the same. The goal, we uh we write it in yellow, um sometimes purple, but for the sake of this explanation, yellow is the goal Secondly, we go to the moment you express a goal or somebody set shares their goal, the first thing that happens is in their head, their brain goes, yeah, but and they come up with these obstacles You know, I've got these things kind of in the way. So we've got a goal, then obstacles. The clearer you can be uh when you spill this out. If you can use the same words and the same feelings that they use to describe the the things which are in their way, they lean in because It was White Woodsmall. Uh said, when you can articulate a person's problem better than they can, they automatically and unconsciously credit you with knowing the solution. So we want to nail the problems next, right? Third, we go milestones and the milestones are hey if you didn't have that problem and you have this sub-result instead In green, the milestones, right? So if I have green plus green plus green, I get my goal, right? And then finally what we've got is we've got uh Accelerators. Accelerators are like the project or the how. What are we going to work on to make that happen? We do those in blue. And for for your model, there's either going to be two for each, sometimes there's three for each. But in terms of symmetry and balance, they're always going to be two or three. It's never going to be two here and three there. So let's call it two for today. So there's going to be you have project one, project two, project three, four, five, and six. So we call those accelerators or blues. Okay. So now we've got this simple model. And if you notice it tells a story. Man, you want this goal. It's a really important goal because of these reasons. But there's three things in the way. Thing one stops you thing two holds you back and thing three makes it much much harder people like huh that's 100% true so what I want to do is I want to show you how to way to instead of this get that oh I like that instead of this Replace it with that. Oh yeah. Instead of this, get a bit of that. Oh I like the sound of that, Alfie. Shall we do it? I think we should. How does it work? I'm glad you asked. To make this happen, we do one, two, or one, two, and three. To make that happen, we we focus on this and then we install that. To make this happen, we do this and that. Does that make sense? Big picture? What we've got right now is it is not just I've got this course, but we've got a course that takes you on a journey and it's well laid out. So together, what we're going to do is we're going to build out your yellow, your red, your greens, and your blues to make this all work. Now let me show you how we use it marketing and sales and delivery-wise, just real quick. Okay, so let's just bust out a simple framework that you've probably heard from us before. Attract, get leads, convert, assign clients, deliver great results to clients in a scalable way. So, uh when you're marketing, prospects have seen a bunch of promises, but what they haven't seen Is a plan. And you see the model we just laid out gives people the whole journey. You're here, these are the reasons you're stuck. Yep. This is what you want instead. Uh-huh. This is how we do it. Well, okay. A plan. On the sales side of things, let's say you're on a phone call with a with a potential client. We can use this same model uh our uh our triangle here and once we've laid it out and we can walk them through these and just ask them a really simple diagnostic question. If you think about a set of traffic lights, Mr. Prospect When it comes to an audience that is growing every single week, so I've got more prospects than I need, would you say you're green? Yellow or red right now? Say I'm red. Okay, let's mark that down as a red. That's something we want to fix. And so when it's diagnostic, people get a bunch of confidence that A, if you've diagnosed them, you've probably got a solution. So when it comes to um prospects, we use it as a diagnostic tool Whether it's one-on-one or it's on a call or it's a video that they watch before a call or it's in a group, we use it in all those ways. And then for clients, what it really does is it maps out uh the milestones The projects for them to work on. So You'll um you'll get a bunch of this over the next little while, but I just want to give you some context about this Swiss Army knife tool, why it's worth spending a little bit of time drawing out a simple triangle. You with me? Promise? Okay. So, with a plan, what does it do? Well, firstly, it tells a story of a journey. And the journey goes, goal. Obstacles. Milestones. Accelerators or projects That stuff just gives people a ton of confidence that hey this person you has a plan I'd like to get on that you know I'd like to see if we can implement that plan on me So first it gives them a plan, it's a story, and the story has those four components. With uh prospects in a convert setting We use it to traffic light where they're up to, where they're stuck, where they're good. And what that allows you to do is when it comes to talking to people about your program or your offer, instead of telling them everything, it allows you to focus and be incredibly relevant. So we can, you know, touch on the things that they care about less, but we can really major on the stuff that they really want to know. Okay? Otherwise we spend a big chunk of that time talking about the stuff that isn't as important to them and if they've said, I need that red and this red and that red and the other stuff's kind of okay, let's not spend all the time talking about the stuff that's okay. Let's focus on the stuff that they really want. And then with with clients and we're focused on projects, it allows us to do two things. It allows everybody to instantly know what's their right next thing, RNT, while at the same time having a really clear picture of The future. So it gives them content to do right now and context for how it fits and where where we're going. Does that make sense? So um I just wanted to give you that as a oops. as a uh an overview of how this thing works and uh in a little bit what we're gonna do is we're gonna build out yours and again it goes Yellow, but these reds are in the way. What you want instead of these greens and how we do it is whoops How we do it is one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. Let me show you an example. This is one for a it's kind of loosely based on a program we run. I tweaked it a little bit Imagine you're a coach, you're just getting started and you want to hit $10,000 a month, your kind of infancy business. So it starts in the middle with a goal. My goal for you is really simple. It's to get you to $10,000 a month. Why $10K? $10K for a new coach is life-changing money. Right? It's the moment you can go from like part-time side hustle to your main gig. It pays the bills, it gets you about stuff it gets you stable and it gives you a platform to grow from. 10K a month is the first major milestone after you've got your first client or two. Okay. So the reason more coaches don't hit 10 grand a month is because of three big problems. And I'm gonna gloss over these, but you get the idea. Number one, the lead flow is really poor. Yeah, some some yeah, you you're working really hard, sometimes you get distracted, but there's there's sometimes leads, there's uh often no leads or not nearly enough leads. It's not even feast or famine, it's like famine and Less famine, right? Lead flow is really patchy. It's incredibly difficult to grow a business if the lead flow is poor. The second big problem is when you when you do get a lead and you finally end up on a sales call with somebody. Those sales conversations can be super awkward because you're selling yourself and if you're a new coach, you don't have like the rock solid confidence and certainty in yourself that you've got the goods. And so those conversations sometimes go off track, the prospects in more control than you are, and they give you objections and excuses and stalls, and it's hard. So we're just marinating in Red's world a little bit. Okay. The third big reason is you you've probably got some. Some doubts, some fears about your ability to deliver, both your ability to actually get a client the result they're after, and secondly that even if the program's great Can you really manage, you know, five or ten or twenty clients all at once without all of the wheels coming off and you being exposed for not having your crap together? Reds, tick. So what do we want instead? So if we do our job right, the path to 10K has got three key milestones. Number one, instead of poor lead flow, what we want instead is leads every day. Some simple systems that get new people into your world and every single day somebody raising their hand and saying, hey, I'm interested in this topic, can we talk? Instead of awkward sales, we want clients every week. If we've got new people into our world every day, once a week we want one new client to sign up at least. Again, I'm doing this quickly, but you get the idea. And then instead of delivery fears, what we want is delivery confidence, a feeling of certainty that A, the stuff will get someone from mission to mission accomplished. And secondly, that it's doable in a way that's scalable for you and get the outcomes you're after. You know, so they can get the outcomes they're after, and for you, you can manage the whole thing in a few hours a week. So they're the three outcomes. How do we do it? And then we walk through the the blues. Okay, so that's the story. We always tell it from the um From the middle out. And usually, you know, we go here, here, and then there And then you know we tell the the details. Does that kind of make sense? So inside out is how we draw it. Looks a bit like a weird Mickey Mouse. Let me get rid of those. So that's a great marketing video. It's the marketing video we use to sell that exact course or a course kind of like it. In sales, how do we use it? Well in sales we use it like this. So we walk people through the the stuff. Each one of these things here doesn't just have a drawing, simpler for me, but they've got a a name, a label that somebody gets and they want. And we can go, let's say this one is about um uh growing your audience, which that one is. It's about uh audience that grows every single day. Uh and we just go, hey, when it comes to growing your audience, uh would you say it's Green, the audience is growing every single day and you've got more than enough leads, not just to hit your goals, but to hit them fast. Are you yellow? Well you're doing you're getting some leads, but it it could be better. Or is it red? Lead gen is a real issue for you. And they'll say, you know what, it's red. Cool. And we just do that for each of our steps. And you're going to end up with a prospect who's got like a bunch of reds around their around their thing. Probably some yellows. And a green or two. Oops, those are meant to be green. And guess what? Now you've diagnosed and they can go, holy crap, I've got a I've got two greens here and a bunch of reds. I'd like some help. And then delivery-wise, again, people are going to go through your course in a linear modular fashion, but while they're doing that. This allows you to this allows to give them context for the whole journey and also go, hey, you know what? That's the bit I'm gonna focus on right now. So big picture, that should give you a bit of an overview about how this thing, how this thing works. Couple of big reminders. The content's going to be great. What's missing for most people is context, both marketing sales and delivery context Our job is to lead people through it and in order for them to say yes, I'd like your help, they need to know with what. This picture gives them a really clear where are we going and how does it work. So we talked about people in the marketplace need a plan. People um your prospects on the on the phone or however you sell want a plan and then a diagnostic. And then clients want to know how do I apply that? What do I work on first? And then where are we going? You also understand right now, colors. We're going to use these a bunch. We've got yellows, that's the middle. We've got reds, the frustrations or obstacles in the way. We've got greens, which are our milestones, and then we've got blues, which are our accelerators or projects to do. So what comes next? What comes next is do we build it? We're gonna build this together step by step, one video each. Each step is quite short, so the videos won't be as long as this one. For each one, we're just gonna take this one worksheet and we're gonna build it out step by step by step. So you don't need multiple sheets here. We're gonna build out your triangle model as it says on the top. Cool. So if you're ready for that journey, I'll see you on the next video. Let's start with the middle, getting the the uh outcome just right. This has been really fun. I can't wait to uh see your triangle. Give us feedback as you go in chat or in the group. And let's build this out. Big love. I'll see you in the next one.
