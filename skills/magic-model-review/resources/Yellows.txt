Alright, let's start to build out this triangle model. As I said in the last one, we're going to start with the triangle itself. The yellow in our drawing. What's the yellow? It's the result. So it could be the name of your program. But more often than not, it's a result. Often your program is called You know the result, but sometimes it's not because we've already got a name and we just need to build a model around the thing. So we want the outcome in the middle. If we don't have this right, people look at your stuff and they won't buy. They'll balk, they'll give you an excuse, they'll They'll not buy. And the big question they're answering is okay, so if I get this thing, what does it do for me? And we want the result to be right there, front and center. If we do this right, two things will happen. Number one, I get it. Number two, I want it. That's the goal. I get it and I want it. So if we can figure that out and put I get it and I want it into the center of the triangle, we are cooking with gas. Okay, so Um here's the thing. Sometimes people who build a course, whether it's a hero program or it's a monthly recurring revenue program or it's just the onboarding. They fill it with all the stuff that they know. You don't want to teach people everything you know. You want to give them what they need to know to get the outcome that they want. Okay? So what goes in the middle of a triangle? It's the it's the result, it's the outcome. It wants to be really concrete. The second big mistake I see is that is people put conceptual stuff. It's like how to learn all of these things. Or they give you um intangible things you know like you'll feel better you'll be more clear that's great dude but if I feel better uh I feel better so that I can what Okay, or I'll be more clear about what we want to make it really concrete, not conceptual and up in the clouds. Ideally the outcome is something I can point to and go, oh look, we did that thing. See that thing? Yeah, that's what we did. Third big mistake is we use our own words for things, not our prospect's word for things. It's okay to kind of sexy up and give them some cool lingo, but they need to instantly go, oh yeah, I want that. And that's only possible if we if we map it to their actual desire. And secondly, we give them um you know we we use their language back to them. Don't make it too clever. We want to be clear, not clever. So in the example I showed you in the last video, our program was called clients Because that's what they want, right? The result is $10,000 a month because I can point to it and they want that too. Okay? So let's chat a little bit to make this to make this clear. I want to give you three product names, three product examples that I really, really love. One I might have mentioned in the last video, there's a bottle of energy drink called Five Hour Energy. It's a great name. I'm not buying an energy in drink, I'm buying five hours of extra energy. I love that. So you can name it by the result. You can name it by the problem. I don't own a lawnmower, so I haven't had this happen, but it happened to my dad, where he's got a lawnmower or a it could be a car engine and you're you're starting the thing or chainsaw and it just won't start In Australia, there's a can of spray in a yellow, you know, yellow spray can by a company called New Lawn. And it's called Start Your Bastard. You can just imagine a bunch of Australian dudes in the 80s and 90s in their short shorts and their you know their little singlets. out there on a Saturday morning, oh come on start you bastard. It's named by the problem. I think that's a great name. So we want the result. We want it to be something they either they either want or they can go, oh that's not me, right? So I think those are those are great. The third thing in terms of clarity is there's a movie. It's not a good movie. It's got Samuel Jackson in it, I think. It's called Snakes on a Plane. I haven't seen it, but I imagine there's a plane and it's got snakes on it. Instantly I know what's in the box. That's kind of the main idea. What's in it? What do I get out of it? So start your bastard, five-hour energy, snakes on a planet. We want to be clear like that. Is that cool? Um six minute abs is a great example. You get the idea. So um Again, triangle-wise, you know what we're doing here. When it comes to our triangle, we're just figuring out what's in the triangle and we're not worrying about any of the peripheral stuff outside. We call it the yellow. And we want to put our result bang in the center. So let's let's do this together. Oops, wrong button. So uh what I love you to do is to grab your triangle model worksheet. I'm gonna get rid of all this stuff on the outside, and we're gonna spend a bit of time here on the on the center. It's okay if this takes you a few goes. In fact, it probably should. Okay, so uh we're gonna brainstorm a few names together and then I'm gonna give you some filters to kind of run it past to make it make yours even better. Okay, so If you think about this, somebody signs up to work with you. What's the outcome that they want? Okay. Do they want leads? Do they want clients? Do they want to grow? Do they want um you know if it's a dating thing, do they want Mr. or Mrs. Wright? Do they want abs? Just big picture, what's the outcome? You've probably already got a name for your program, and if you do, just bang that in and we'll run it through the test in a minute. But we want We want to know what's the result. What's the thing that if they could point to that, they'd know that hey, we've done great work here and I've kind of made it at least to this this stage of the journey Okay, so what I want you to do is write down three ideas for what the result could be. Don't worry about getting the name just right, but three ideas for the results. And then we're gonna run it through these these tests. Um number one. Oops, let let's number them. So again, we're going to come up with an idea, like what what are the outcomes? That's our first step. Step two is we're going to come up with some names. And then we're going to ask these questions. Do they instantly get it? Or does it need explaining? I run a program called Black Belt. Most people would think I run a karate school. That's why the company's called Million Dollar Coach and the front-end program is called Clients, right? That's a mistake. So what's the result? The result of the black belt program is a lifestyle empire, right? Okay, I I want one of those, right? So do they get it? Number two, do they want it? Okay. Number three, can they point to it? In other words, feeling better is okay. And so if you've got like an intangible offer, we want to make it as tangible as we possibly can. And if you can help You know lots and lots of people about lots of different stuff with your methodology and it makes them feel better. That's cool. I think you'll do even better if for now, not forever, but for now we pick one target market, ideal who's kind of uh at the top end of the food pyramid. And we can apply your system to a specific who who has a specific use case for the tools you've got. Okay? So can I point to it? And ideally, we can language it as how much. By when? Okay? And if you've done your offer diamond work, this will sound vaguely familiar, right? It's um what's the result and how long does it take? Okay, so um let's recap and I'll give you homework. I want you to put the middle of your triangle as the result that you that people want. They want to be able to point to it. It's the big goal of the work we do together. So here's the actions. I want you to firstly think about the the results that you could get. Number two, come up with three possible titles. Number four. So um step one. What are the results? Step two Three possible results Okay, to try on. Then step three, we're gonna run it through these filters. Step four, we're gonna ask for some feedback from the coaching team here. If you say it and people get it and they want it and it's simple and clear, super concrete, and they can point to it, I think we're kind of winning. Alright? So that's your assignment for right now. The moment you're done, Come to the next video. But spend a little bit of time on this. Yeah, five minutes, ten minutes. Don't spend five days. It doesn't take that long. Okay? Spend a little bit of time on this. In the next video Then the next piece out from the triangle is the red obstacles, but we're actually going to design it from the greens and then go reds next. And I'll explain why in the next video. It just makes it helps you get a better finished product and it means you pick obstacles that you've actually got a solution for Alright, so in our next video we're going to work on our greens together and I will see you there. Your job right now? Possible what are the results? Possible names, run them through the filters, pick the one that feels best. Okay? I'll see you soon.
