Alright dude, so well done so far. We've got a middle of the triangle that's looking pretty good. Our goal for these, just so you know, is to get to You know, if you think about like perfection, orgasmic perfection, we don't want to get that great yet. Somewhere between that and a shitty first draft is good. So start with shitty first drafts and then we'll just kind of tweak them as we as we go. Now if we think about this triangle model, we've got our a yellow Right, that's good. When we're explaining this to prospects, the next thing we're gonna do is these ones. But in terms of building it together, we're gonna skip over that one and come back next because I find it's easier to reverse engineer the the red ones once we've got really clear about these. If we know what those are then we go what's the frustration they've got that maps to You're the answer I've got, so we're not kind of leaping from I've got this problem, but I actually want to teach you about this other thing. I'll show you this other thing. Does that make sense? So today we're gonna go greens first So uh here's what happens. If you don't have this right, clients get lost. Right? They need to know where are we going, how do I make progress along the way, what are the the three wins which make up the big win. Okay, so we we end up giving people too much stuff, too much modules, too much content, they get really bogged down. Um we need we need to go, yes, there's this epic end result but there's three big results that we're gonna hit along the way. So we're gonna give people a simple plan with three exciting milestones so they feel like they can make progress and every time they jump into a new part of our triangle, you know whether it's a one or two or three. That we're focused on something with an outcome, not just doing busy work. Okay, so a couple of mistakes that people make. Naming your greens by an area like lead generation or organizational chart or clarity, areas are fine, but I want to know a result. Ideally something I can point to that I want. The second big mistake is Is lots of logic in the thing and no emotions. So we're gonna kind of we're gonna think about what's the real what's the area, what's the result, uh what do they want, how do they want it, how do they want to feel and together that's gonna give us an idea about how to language these things well. Okay So again, we'll think area, outcome, feeling. And ideally we want like two to three words for each one because if you end up with like with a long sentence. It's just hard, right? So ideally we want something as simple as um leads every day or um competent delivery. Yeah, competent delivery, right? Two or three words which say this is what I'm gonna get. Is that alright? So uh I want you to think about these like they are milestones on a journey. So What I mean by that specifically is think about your um your one, two, and three like their stops on an epic journey. So if this is like uh a round-the-world trip And this could be your epic adventure through Asia, your trip through South America. and um you know some kind of tropical paradise. They each want to feel like destinations you want to get to. Oops, I just realized I wasn't screen sharing. They want to feel like destinations you want to get to, not just stops on the June. So they want to feel like worthy goals in them in themselves like, oh I'd love to go to Asia, I'd love to get more leads. Or yeah, South America sounds great. I'd love to sign up clients every every week. Yeah? So they want to feel like greats great results that together 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 3 equals the big end result. That's kind of what we're going to build together. So let's let's do a little bit of work see how much of this we can get done together right now. What I want you to do is think about in order for people to get this yellow outcome in the middle, in order for people to get here, what are the three things that they'd need to work on. So we'll start with categories or areas, right? So if a coach in our world wants to grow the business, they're gonna need some Marketing help, we'd call that attract, they're gonna want some sales help, we'll call that convert, and they're gonna want to focus on the way they deliver their stuff. Attract, convert, deliver. Now that's good. It's not sexy yet, but the areas are right. So the very first thing I want you to do is think about what are the areas. Okay, so you might um uh that's we're gonna go first. Then let's see if we can't sexy these things up. I'm gonna do it with a little sheet called the milestone maker. So we've got our three areas we just talked about. And this is what you're gonna do in a moment. You're gonna go uh attract, convert, and deliver. Don't use mine, use yours. Just go, hey, to get that outcome, what are the three things that I that I need to work on with somebody? And for each one, uh what do they want? Well, attract what they really want is leads. Cool. Let's just do one column together. They want leads. How do they want them? Well they want them frequently. They want them Daily and they want them easy. Okay, cool. How do they want to feel? Well they want to feel uh confident I guess And then we're going to put these things together and come up with a two to three-word slogan, like a bumper sticker of the result. And so that result might be, in my case, it's leads. every day. Cool? And you know what? That's the one I ended up picking so I'm just gonna go with it. Okay? And that's how we do it. We're going to do the same process for your second one and your third one. But just go, what do they want? How do they want it? Yes, they want sales. How do they want sales? They want them to come easy. Okay, how do they want to feel? Kind of confident, certain, um effortless, frictionless, perfect. And you might come up with effortless sales Cool? So that's the process. Let's um I'm gonna do that for all three. So some reminders Your three greens, we're gonna do them first because it's easy to reverse engineer from what we want to what they're missing right now. So we're gonna do it green and then come back to red. Just in the building it. When we share it with people, we always go from the middle to the red to the green to the blue. How do we do it? We go, what are the three areas? Next, what do they want? How do they want it? How do we want them to feel? We come up with a couple of drafts and we settle on something that's Pretty good. We'll tweak this forever. I still tweak Gows every now and again, so don't stress if you don't. Okay, so here's your homework. Here's your assignment. Fill in this milestone maker for each of your three areas Areas along the top and then just go deep one by one. So first column, what do they want? How do they want it? How do they want to feel? Come up with a draft, play with a little bit and get to a two to three-word thing. And do the same for column two, same for column three. Bonus points if they kind of sound the same, and we'll we'll polish our triangle up at the end of this process, but bonus points if they sound kind of the same, like they fit together So we don't want feel great sales with the automated client machine. One's about feelings and one sounds like a theme. So try to get them to fit together if you can. Bonus points if you can. We'll do it later if you can't. So once you've got once you've got this done, all I want you to do is sketch out your triangle with the middle, skip the red, come and fill in your greens, see how it feels. And that's it. In our next video, um dude what we're gonna do is we're gonna reverse engineer from these greens that we've just settled on and pick a red that feels great. Okay
