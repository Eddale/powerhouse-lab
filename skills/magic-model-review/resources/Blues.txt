Alright, alright, alright, we're looking good. Uh firstly, a confession. I'm breaking a golden rule of TV, movies, and recording trainings Apparently you're not supposed to show the ceiling. But I'm in a hotel room in Tokyo and I'm standing up and I'm quite tall. I've got a table stacked upon a table and we're just gonna go with it. I won't tell if you promise not to tell. Is that deal? Alright, so here's where we're up to. We're building out our triangle. As we know, it's a model for marketing and selling and delivering our stuff that is epic, simple, and elegant. And uh we started off with our yellow, our kind of result, the sweet spot. And we got a draft of that, which is which is good. Um then Together we figured out what are the three greens, the three kind of success milestones along the way, knowing that when we deliver it, we're actually gonna do the red ones first, but it's easy to kind of reverse engineer. But kind of it basically goes, you want this thing, but there's three things in the way. If we solve those, we get these three kind of juicy results. And now we're at the point where it gets really fun. We get to kind of show the plan, which is like here's how we here's how we achieve these greens. And we're gonna end up with uh either two or or three blues for each. The blues are what we'd call uh an accelerator or a project and uh when it comes to designing these out there's a There's a kind of few things that we want to avoid. And together our goal is a little bit better than shitty first draft, but we're going to polish it together over the next little while. Okay, so don't stress if you don't get this perfect first time. Because nobody does. So let's let's chat. Often what happens is when you show people the modules, two things happen. Firstly, they go, oh, that feels like a lot of work. And it is. Um and secondly it's like oh feels like a lot of work and I don't know if it's worth it. Like what's the point? It's like you know in maths math for you American compadres when they start teaching you algebra I'm like okay this is really hard when am I ever gonna use this that's that's what we want to avoid And so instead the goal with these blues is we want to get the the right ones, you know, as few as we need and as many as you know, as many as we need, as few as possible. But we want to we want to name them in such a way as it sounds like, oh, I actually want that result. Each project should be named by a result or at least sounds like something cool that I really, really want. So today we're just gonna get the ideas right and then uh Next video, I'm gonna show you how to like how to test your triangle, how to make it better. Okay, but for today we just want to get the ideas golden. Um So here's some mistakes. Actually I should show you one thing for context that I think will really really help. So you're gonna end up with let's pretend it's uh for for the sake of simplicity. Oops, let's let's go in and have two Two modules, two blues, two accelerators, two projects, those words are all interchangeable Two modules for each of our thing. It gives us like six modules. What's actually going to happen is for each of these modules, let's just take this one right here because it's It's uh ready, willing, enable. Let's say for this one here, there's probably gonna be for each module there might there's gonna be a few little videos to explain it. We call those planets. And each planet is like seven to fifteen minutes, something like that. A little bit like these videos we're watching together. So you might have like two or three little planets that explain it step by step by step. And as you go, you'll end up adding what we call satellites, which is like little FAQs or upgrades or improvements to the to the thing just to give it some context. Like oh this question came up so you don't have to re-record your whole course you can just add uh add a little satellite around it So for today, we don't need to worry about the the planets or the satellites. We just want to get our our projects right. Okay. Um so mistakes. Number one, we add too many modules. We want two for each of our greens or three for each of our greens. We're gonna end up with six or we're gonna have nine, whichever. I love six, but sometimes we need a bit more. That's okay. Number two, we don't want to teach people everything we know about a topic. We just need to give them what they need to know to get the job done. I just mentioned planets and satellites. We don't need that for now. I probably could have just left it out. And saved you 60 seconds and going, oh, there's more. We'll get there. It's fine. Number three, and we'll we'll do this really when it comes to testing your triangle in the next video. I really like it when there's symmetry. So Two here, two here, two here, or three, three, and three. Good. Two, three, four. Yeah, not good. Simple. We want it to look balanced, right? When it comes to naming them, you know, again, in the next video we'll talk about naming them so they sound like they match, like they're small, medium, large, not Starbucks, what's up with Venti Grand uh Grande? What is it? Tall Venti Grande. It's like, well, hang on, we've got. Tall and short, we've got Grande and Smolo, and we've got a number. I don't understand it. So we don't we're gonna do we're not gonna do that. Starbucks has done pretty well over it. We're not gonna do that. We're just gonna be simple and clean analytics. So our job today is really simple. For each of these three greens, we're going to come up with two or three. projects to work on and don't worry about getting the names right I just want you to get the ideas right so let's say this one was about um about marketing Obviously it's named cooler than that, but let's say it's about marketing. Well there might be yeah, there might be a few key things. There's gonna be um understand your avatar could be a thing. One could be about messaging. And one could be about, let's say there's three. One could be about your first campaign or your first ad or first video or something like that. that okay so don't worry about the graphics all I want you to know is like if we had to achieve this thing and we broke that down into two or three key pieces what are they So the activity today is really simple. It's to look at each of your greens and just do a brainstorm list for all of the things that you could teach and then go, hey, if I could only give them two or three, what are the most important things? And it might mean you merge some together. into a module, we can later break that up into planets. Okay, so all we're gonna do is for each green, what are the one or two things that they need, sorry, two or three things that they need to do to achieve that thing. Think about like what are the what are the little projects? for them to go on on this quest towards green. Cool. I think that's it. So let me just look at my notes, make sure. We're going to pick two or three projects, blue projects per green, and then just ask yourself once you've got them, hey, if they do what um you know for this green area, if they do one, two, and three, or if they do one and two, do they get the outcome? Yes, we're looking good. Is there a situation where they could do one, two, and three and still not get the outcome? If so, there's probably something missing. And is it possible that they could do one, two, and three, uh, or they could get the outcome without having to do say three, but they could do one and two and get the outcome. Maybe we're teaching too much. Is that cool? So we're going to cut as much as we can or add what we need to. Okay? So this is your mission. Should you choose to accept it, look at your greens. Figure out what are the two or three projects for each and then we're just going to do a tiny little balance test. Do we have two all the way around or do we have three? If you've got one with three and they have to be three, then we're probably going to balance it out with three on the other sides. Is that cool? So a little reminder, all we're doing here is we're giving people the the projects. You know, we're gonna teach them as modules, but for them it's like a project. Okay, I'm gonna get my avatar sorted. That's a that's a that's a little project. Cool. So uh Two or three projects for each one. Look for balance. So we've got two here, two here, two here, or three, three, and three. I've said that like nine times, so it's probably important. And uh in the next video we're gonna pimp these out together. So I'm gonna we're gonna work on symmetry of number, which hopefully you'll have anyway by the time we get there. We're gonna work on naming our stuff. And I'm just gonna give you some tests to run for your yellow, your red, your green, and your blue. So it's Ready for testing in the marketplace. I just want to say one thing. Please don't stress about getting this perfect. I was messaging literally Two hours ago with a black belt member who I've known I've been working with for probably well not probably ten years one month ago we started his name's Jeff good guy And he was like, oh, I'm probably not going to be a big success salary like your other clients because I haven't like, I'm not scaling. And I said, like, dude, honestly, uh, our genius model, you know, our three circle Venn thing. had scale in the middle and it was the right idea but the wrong word. Not everybody needs to scale. Not everybody wants to scale. Not everybody should scale. But what everybody wants is to build what I would call now, now that I've got words for it, a lifestyle empire. You know, it's it's more than enough money and more than enough time and more than enough impact for you to live an amazing life. Awesome! Cool. Why do I tell you that? Because like four months ago, three months ago, I changed the word scale in our core model. from scale to lifestyle empire. And so you're going to be tweaking and revising yours as you go. Is that cool? Alright, so you know what to do. For every green, let's pick the two or three projects for people to work on. In the next video, I'm going to sharpen these up. We're going to test your whole triangle and we're going to make your words great. I'm going to teach you a great tool called the product handle. But to do that, I want you to have a draft of this, you know, this sexy little triangle ready. Okay? Work on blues. You know what to do. I'll talk to you soon.
