# Offer Diamond Review - How It Works

## The One-Sentence Version

It's like having Ed look at a coach's offer structure and type exactly what he'd say in a supportive Facebook comment.

## Why This Exists

BlackBelt members submit their Offer Diamonds for feedback. These are their offer frameworks - the visual map of how they make "yes" easy for prospects.

Reviewing them takes time. You need to check five different elements, write in a voice that's supportive but direct, and stay within Facebook's format constraints.

This skill captures the review process. Upload the Offer Diamond, get feedback ready to paste.

## The Mental Model: The Offer Doctor

Think of an Offer Diamond like a health checkup for your offer. Five vital signs to check:

**Promise** - Is the result clear and sized right? "Thin thighs in 30 days" beats "get fit."

**Guarantee** - Does it make starting feel safe? Reduce the risk, increase the yes.

**Bonuses** - Do they speed up results? Or are they random "kitchen sink" additions?

**Payment Plan** - Is it shaped for an easy yes? Weekly often beats monthly psychologically.

**Urgency/Scarcity** - Is there a real reason to decide now? No fake pressure.

Each vital sign matters. Weak on any one and the offer underperforms.

## How You Actually Use It

Someone posts their Offer Diamond screenshot in the BlackBelt group. You want to give feedback.

Upload the image and say "review this offer diamond."

The skill evaluates all five points, writes conversational feedback in Ed's voice, and gives you a code block ready to paste into Facebook.

Copy. Paste. Done.

## The Voice

The output doesn't sound like a report. It sounds like Ed typing a quick response to a peer:

"Nice clarity here. The promise is doing a lot of heavy lifting already. One small tweak that might help is tightening the timeframe..."

Supportive. Direct. Practical. Never lecturing.

## What It's NOT

This isn't a pricing consultant. It evaluates offer structure, not whether the price is right.

This isn't a copy editor. It doesn't rewrite their promise - it evaluates whether the promise is clear.

This isn't a sales funnel analyzer. It stays focused on the five diamond points. Funnel strategy is a different conversation.

## The Coaching Analogy

When a coach shows you their offer, the goal isn't to tear it apart. The goal is to make "yes" easier for their prospects.

Every piece of feedback should answer: "What would make this offer more likely to convert?"

That's the lens. Conversion confidence, not theoretical perfection.

## The Facebook Constraint

The output needs to work as a Facebook comment. That means:
- No headers or bullet points
- Conversational flow
- 2-5 specific improvements (not a comprehensive audit)
- Immediately postable

The constraint is actually helpful. It forces focus. What are the 2-5 things that would make the biggest difference?
