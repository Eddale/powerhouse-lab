# Creating an Irresistible Offer: Crafting Your Promise

^f085b8

## The Offer Diamond Framework
This training focuses on the first element of the five-part "Offer Diamond": the **Promise**. The framework balances risk and reward:
- **Reward side**: Promise and Bonuses
- **Risk reduction side**: Guarantee and Payment Plan
- **Center fulcrum**: Urgency and Scarcity

## The Core Problem
Prospects fail to commit because they clearly see the expense but lack clarity on the value they'll receive. This creates three enemies: **Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (F-U-D)**. The solution is building "conversion confidence"—the confidence prospects need to commit to themselves, their future, and you.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Selling Deliverables Instead of Outcomes
Don't focus on:
- Number of Zoom calls or hours
- Facebook groups, webinars, or events
- Course material or sessions

**Sell the outcome these deliverables create**, not the deliverables themselves.

### Mistake #2: Selling the Process Instead of the Result
Don't describe the journey (strategic planning sessions, weekly coaching calls, six-week reviews). Instead, sell the destination—like selling "sitting in a hammock in Costa Rica" rather than describing airport security and flight delays.

## Formula for an Effective Promise

### Key Components
1. **Specific Result**: What exactly will they achieve?
2. **Set Time Frame**: How long will it take?
3. **Desirability**: Something they actually want
4. **Tangibility**: Can you "point to it" when it happens?

### The "Thin Thighs in 30 Days" Standard
Great examples include:
- "The Four-Hour Work Week"
- "Thin Thighs in 30 Days"
- "Five-Hour Energy"
- "Start Your Bastard" (lawn mower spray)

Each has crystal-clear outcomes with specific timeframes.

## Promise Size and Time Frame Strategy

### Short-Term Programs (Hero Products)
Make small, believable promises in short timeframes. They're easier to buy and easier to deliver.

### Long-Term Programs
Use the **"First, Next, Then"** framework:
- **First** (30-90 days): Immediate, achievable outcome
- **Next** (Medium-term): Progressive results
- **Then** (Long-term): Ultimate transformation

**Example**: Weight loss program
- First: Cravings disappear in two weeks, establish healthy habits
- Next: Lose approximately 1 kilo per week
- Then: Reach ideal weight and build muscle for lasting physique

## Program Examples
- **"Clients"**: Get to $10K/month (for new coaches)
- **"20-Day New Patient Boot Camp"**: Clear timeframe and outcome
- **"Million Dollar Coach"**: Long-term Black Belt program promise
- **"Launchpad"**: Foundation building in first few months

## Action Items

### Worksheet Exercise
1. Define your current program's outcome
2. Evaluate using the "traffic light" system (red/yellow/green):
   - Is it specific enough?
   - Do they want it?
   - Can they see it happening?
   - Can you "point to it"?
3. Brainstorm improvements to make your promise sharper and more desirable
4. Add your refined promise to the Offer Diamond page
5. Share in the Facebook group for feedback
6. Bring to coaching calls for team refinement

### The Tangibility Test
Ask yourself: **"Can I point to it?"**
- Avoid vague promises like "feel better" or "improve your business"
- Aim for concrete outcomes like "10 new clients from existing leads"

## Key Takeaway
**People buy certainty.** While you can't guarantee outcomes (clients must do the work), you can confidently state what your program is **designed to achieve** in a specific timeframe. Small promises are easier to buy and keep—they build trust and create offers that sell themselves.

## Next Steps
The next video will address the question: "What happens if I do everything and it still doesn't work for me?" covering guarantees and risk reduction.

# Designing Irresistible Guarantees to Remove Risk and Increase Conversions

## The Core Problem

When prospects hesitate after perfect sales calls despite having a clear problem and understanding your solution, it's because they don't feel safe to commit. The issue isn't conviction—it's too much perceived risk and not enough reward. Your job is to remove all risk so saying "no" becomes illogical.

## The Psychology of Guarantees

**Key Insight:** The best clients don't need guarantees—they're focused on winning. However, guarantees serve to make it safe for prospects to get started. You need just enough guarantee to eliminate hesitation, not to cover the entire program. Balance buyer safety with protection against unmotivated clients.

**Common Mistakes:**
- Believing guarantees remove "skin in the game" (clients still need commitment, but your offer must be a no-brainer)
- Having no guarantee by default rather than by design (make it a deliberate choice backed by a story)
- If you'd help an upset client who did everything right anyway, put that promise upfront to convert more prospects

## Two Approaches to Risk

**Remove the Risk:** Make it risk-free to start (trial periods, money-back guarantees)

**Reverse the Risk:** Make it better than risk-free (refund PLUS additional compensation)

**Example:** A coach offering a $10K/10-week program promises to generate $10K, provides a complete refund if it doesn't work, PLUS $1,000 to spend on another coach. This reverses risk entirely—clients come out ahead even if it fails.

## The Horse Story Framework

A farmer choosing between two horses for his daughter illustrates the power of risk removal:
- **Seller 1:** "$1,500, take it or leave it" (too much risk)
- **Seller 2:** "Try it for a week. My son will bring oats daily and clean up. If it's perfect, pay me. If not, I'll take the horse back—no charge." (zero risk)

The farmer obviously bought the second horse. Your guarantee should function the same way.

## Effective Guarantee Examples

**Conditional/Action-Based (Rob Nixon's Model):**
"Add $300K in extra profit per partner annually, provided you: don't miss committed projects, don't miss set targets, and attend all three annual events." This rewards good behavior and has never failed for compliant clients.

**30-Day Love It or Leave It:**
"We've known each other 45 minutes. You seem great, I seem great, but we haven't worked together yet. Anytime in the first 30 days, either of us can walk away as friends with no obligation. After 30 days, we're committed for a year."

**Full Buyback Plus Bonus:**
"I'll buy it back at full price plus give you $1,000 to spend on another coach" (note: "buy back" sounds more valuable than "refund")

**Work Until Success:**
"Or I'll work with you for free until you achieve the outcome"

**Payment Pause:**
"Or I'll pause your payments and give you extra one-on-one support"

**Eliminate Time and Money Objections:**
"No payments for the first two months, then 10 payments of $4,800/month" (removes both initial barriers)

## Design Principles

- **Keep it simple:** Explain it in 10 seconds in a way that feels obvious, natural, and fair
- **Avoid weasel clauses:** Excessive legal conditions destroy trust and signal hidden catches
- **Reward good behavior, not bad:** Structure guarantees to incentivize client commitment
- **Don't guarantee everything:** Just guarantee enough to make starting safe
- **Answer "What happens if it doesn't work?"** Have a clear "OR" statement

## Action Items

1. **Traffic light your current guarantee:**
   - **Green:** Takes all risk out, makes prospects feel completely safe
   - **Yellow:** Okay but needs improvement
   - **Red:** Doesn't adequately remove risk

2. **Decide your approach deliberately:** Choose between having a strong guarantee or having no guarantee (with a compelling reason/story for either choice)

3. **Brainstorm guarantee options** that either remove or reverse risk for your specific offer

4. **Add your guarantee to your offer diamond** for review

5. **Remember the goal:** Make it safe to get started. Once clients are in your world, they'll love you and win. The guarantee simply gets them over the edge.

## Key Principle

**A compelling offer beats a convincing argument every time.** Build an offer that sells itself rather than relying on sales skills alone.

# Strategic Bonus Design for Coaching Programs

## Why Bonuses Matter

People often say "no" to offers because of unhandled objections—fears that the process will take too long or be too difficult. Successful programs must be easy to understand, easy to buy, and easy to win with.

## Common Bonus Mistakes

**Mistake #1: The Kitchen Sink Approach**
Adding random stuff without strategy (the "thud factor" mentality). Don't add stuff—add value.

**Mistake #2: Not Thinking Through Objections**
Failing to design bonuses strategically through key lenses: objection handling, speed acceleration, and ease of implementation.

## The Four Strategic Bonus Angles

### 1. **Objection Handlers**
**Example:** Joanna Martin's public speaking program included an 8-minute guided meditation to eliminate fear of speaking on stage—directly addressing the biggest barrier to her "sell from stage" program.

### 2. **Speed Accelerators**
**Example:** Vanessa's webinar program offered a performance-based bonus: complete your webinar outline by week three, and they'll build the entire funnel for you. This accelerated implementation and prepared clients to upgrade faster.

### 3. **Ease Enhancers**
**Example:** Black Belt's Coach Marketing Machine (CMM) software provides pre-built funnels, email campaigns, and templates—clients just click a button and edit headlines. Gets them 98% to the outcome instantly.

### 4. **Intimacy Opportunities**
One-on-one or small group sessions with you. High perceived value, and early buyers are typically fastest to implement and upgrade—creating both delivery and conversion opportunities.

## The Offer Value Formula (Alex Hormozi Model)

**Offer Value = (Desirability × Likelihood of Achievement) ÷ (Effort Required × Sacrifice)**

Bonuses increase the top (desirability and likelihood) while decreasing the bottom (effort and sacrifice). The goal: make it as close to "take a pill, wake up transformed" as possible.

## Types of Strategic Bonuses

- One-on-one or small group calls
- Done-for-you services (funnel builds, VA support)
- Tools and software
- Templates, scripts, and slide decks (plug-and-play resources)
- Intimacy-based fast-action rewards (first 5 buyers get personal access)

## Pro Tip: Repackaging Existing Resources

Your bonuses may already exist within your program. Extract valuable components and reposition them as bonuses to increase perceived value without creating new content.

## Best Practices

- Keep bonuses **congruent**—they must map to your core promise
- Design bonuses as accelerators, objection handlers, or ease enhancers
- Use intimacy bonuses to reward fast action
- Get as close to "done-for-you" as possible
- Focus on tools that are 98% complete (minimal customization needed)

## Action Items

1. **Audit current bonuses** using a red/yellow/green rating system
2. **Identify key objections** your clients have
3. **Design three core bonuses**: one objection handler, one speed accelerator, one ease enhancer
4. **Consider adding** an intimacy bonus for fast action takers
5. **Add bonuses to your offer diamond** for review and workshopping
6. Remember: People buy when reward is high and risk is low—bonuses increase reward

**Next Step:** Work on payment plans to remove the "I can't afford it" objection without discounting.

# Pricing Strategy - Payment Plans Over Discounts

## Core Principle
Change payment **terms**, not payment **amounts**. The goal is to eliminate money objections by making programs affordable through flexible payment options while maintaining value and avoiding burnout from undercharging.

## Two Common Pricing Mistakes
1. **Undercharging** - Not charging what you're worth
2. **Over-discounting** - Responding to objections by lowering prices, leading to undercharging, over-delivering, and burning out

## Key Business Metrics to Track
- **CAC (Client Acquisition Cost)** - What it costs to acquire a client
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)** - Total client spending over their lifetime
- **30-Day Payback** - How much money returns within 30 days (critical for ad-based businesses)

## Three Payment Options

### 1. Upfront Payment
- **Benefit**: Client saves money (typically 2 months worth)
- **Example**: $20,000 upfront
- Best for businesses needing immediate cash flow or ad spend ROI

### 2. Monthly Instalments
- **Benefit**: Easier on client's cash flow
- **Example**: 12 payments of $2,000/month ($24,000 total)
- Include "interest" - instalments should total more than upfront price

### 3. Weekly Payments (Advanced)
- **Benefit**: Smallest perceived amount, highest actual revenue
- **Example**: $600/week = $31,200 annually (vs. $24,000 monthly plan)
- **Math advantage**: 52 weeks/year vs. 48 weeks (12 months × 4 weeks) = extra month of revenue
- People focus on the weekly amount, not contract length

## Proven Results
**25% conversion recovery**: Re-engaging prospects who said "no" with weekly payment options converted 25% of them to "yes"

## Sales Call Language
"There are two (or three) ways you can pay. You can pay upfront and save money, or pay in instalments for easier cash flow. Both options are completely fine with me."

## Pricing Psychology
- People focus on the **amount**, not the **terms**
- Breaking down pricing (daily/weekly) makes it feel more accessible
- Reference: "Sponsor a child for $1/day" ($30/month sounds bigger)

## Strategic Considerations
- **If cash flow is tight or running ads**: Focus on upfront and monthly options
- **If cash flow is strong**: Weekly pricing maximizes revenue
- **Pro tip**: Sell weekly, then offer prepay-and-save options during onboarding

## Action Items
1. ✅ Evaluate current pricing terms - are they working for you and your prospects?
2. ✅ Create at minimum: upfront price + monthly payment plan
3. ✅ Consider adding weekly payment option based on your cash flow situation
4. ✅ Add payment terms to your "offer diamond"
5. ✅ Link pricing to clear ROI ("Give me $10, get $100 back")
6. ✅ Bring completed offer to group for feedback
7. ✅ Watch next video on urgency and scarcity

## Next Steps
Complete the payment structure, then move to creating urgency and scarcity (the "now factor") to drive immediate action

# Adding Urgency and Scarcity

## The Problem with "Let Me Think About It"

This training addresses the final element of the Offer Diamond framework: creating urgency and scarcity to convert prospects from "let me think about it" to "I want it now." The speaker identifies two common mistakes coaches make: failing to give prospects a reason to act immediately, and viewing urgency/scarcity as marketing tricks rather than legitimate business realities.

## The De Beers Principle: Limit Supply to Increase Demand

Using De Beers Diamonds as an example, the speaker illustrates how limiting supply increases demand and value. De Beers stores millions of diamonds in vaults to maintain scarcity and high prices. The key lesson: you already have natural capacity limits in your business—leverage them as sales tools rather than ignoring them.

## Understanding Scarcity vs. Urgency

These are two distinct levers:
- **Scarcity** = Limited number/supply (e.g., "7 spots available this month")
- **Urgency** = Limited time (e.g., "Kickoff call starts next Tuesday")

Most businesses already have both but aren't leveraging them effectively.

## Practical Scarcity Tactics

- Use your real capacity limits (e.g., "I can comfortably take 5 new clients this month, 3 spots already filled")
- Offer fast-action bonuses for the first 2-5 people who join
- Avoid fake scarcity—only use what genuinely exists in your business
- Communicate limited spots transparently in marketing and sales conversations

## Practical Urgency Tactics

- Leverage scheduled onboarding dates ("Our next intake is August 4th")
- Use upcoming training sessions as deadlines ("We're teaching social media content planning next Tuesday")
- Create "miss the train" moments where starting later means missing valuable content
- Keep deadlines near-term (next week/two weeks, not next year)

## Action Items

1. **Audit current urgency and scarcity**: Score your offer as green, yellow, or red—does it give prospects a compelling reason to act now?
2. **Identify your capacity number**: Determine how many clients you can comfortably take this month/week
3. **Identify upcoming events**: Note onboarding calls, training sessions, or deliverables that create natural urgency
4. **Add urgency and scarcity to your Offer Diamond**: Complete this final element alongside your promise, guarantee, bonuses, and payment plan
5. **Share for feedback**: Take a screenshot of your completed Offer Diamond, post it in the group, and prepare to review it on the next coaching call

## The Complete Offer Diamond Framework

The five facets that make offers irresistible:
1. Promise (reward)
2. Guarantee (risk reversal)
3. Bonuses
4. Payment plan
5. Urgency and scarcity (the "now factor")

The speaker emphasizes that a compelling offer beats a convincing argument every time—and when combined with sales skills, it creates a powerful conversion system.
