offer diamond is what we're going to do right now I want to give a shout out to James Kent for helping put this together the offer diamond originally is a model that James put together, James was going to be here with us today to kind of co-pilot this with me and add a little bit of color commentary but he's in Bali right now and he just got COVID for the second time so I got you all the way we're going to have a good time, yeah not super fun So go to this page in your book, offer diamond. And we're just going to start here with this risk-reward ratio. I do have the ebony and ivory headphones going on. I had 

Taki
black 

Taki
AirPods custom made for me. And then dropped one down 20 

Taki
from the 20th 

Taki
floor in Broad Beach. And I dropped the right one. And so then I bought some white ones. 

Taki
And then 

Taki
I managed to lose that in between the handbrake. If Kiramari is cheap, it's in there. I can see it. I just can't get it. So now I'm like, I've got good cop and bad cop ears today. That's how we're going to roll. So if somebody says yes to your offer or says no to your offer, it really comes down to two things. If they say yes, it's because we've got the seesaw here balanced in your favor. ja jos he sanovat "no", niin se on, että on jotain se, että se on "off". Se tulee toisiin suurin piirtein. Se on niin, että, mikä on riskin "järjestelmä"? Ja mikä on "reward" "järjestelmä"? Ja jos on liian paljon riskin kohdalla, niin ihmiset kertovat "no" tai he vain kestävät tai he "ghost". Ja If there's enough reward to overcome the risk, then they'll say yes. But ideally, what we want to do is we want to stack the reward and remove as much of the risk as we possibly can so that doing business with you becomes as close to a no-brainer as we possibly can. If this is making sense so far, can you give me a thumbs up like this? Yeah. So let's just do a quick little think-through. If you think about lead magnet, If you think about lead magnet on your website, something that they give you a name and an email address for, how does risk and reward come into lead magnet? So the offer here is just a really simple magnet. What are some of the risks associated with opting in for a lead magnet? Can you type it in the chat, please? Small reward, smaller risk. Yeah, agreed. Risk, I'm going to get spammed. "Γιαπ, you might spam them." "Yeah, I've got to give up my contact information. I'm going to get spammed by me and Ninos." Right. And so, but if you think about kind of how bad the risk is, it's probably like, it's not all the way out on the edge. It's probably kind of a little bit here, but also the reward of a lead magnet is usually quite low, right? And so it's just got to balance a little bit. What if it wasn't a lead magnet? What if it's booked a sales call? What are the risks associated with booking a sales call? Waste my time. I'm going to get pushed into something. I'm going to feel sold to. Yeah, I might get convinced to buy the thing. Right. I might feel under pressure to buy it. Right. And then so let's just talk about whether you're selling by chat or you're in a sales call. And the thing here isn't a lead magnet and it's not a call. It's to buy the thing. Think it out buying your program, whether it's by chat or by call. What are some of the risks associated? It won'T work for me. What else? Yeah, it's expensive. I might waste my time. I might waste my money. Yep. My bank account's empty right now. Yep. ويسعى المال الذي قد استخدمه في طريق أخر نعم، لن أملك الوقت لفعله نعم، لا أحب المجمع أو لا أحب المشاركة لا أستطيع التبتسيق نعم، لن أملك الوقت لإنشاء ويضع أكثر الأشياء في مجمعي فهذه كلها كلها أسرار حقيقية لكل واحد من مجمعنا إذا كانت أمر يسعى لكي تسعى بشت أو أن تسعى لكي تسعى على محال أو أن تسعى لكي تسعى في مجمع كل هذه الأسرار حقيقية وذلك ما هو remove as much of the risk as we can and heavy down the reward. And there's a couple of things. Have you ever stood on a seesaw? Um, sorry, for the bad drawing. So on see-saw, like, that's fairly evenly balanced, and you can, like, put your weight here. Or you can put your weight there. And flick it so we're going to do some risk removers. We're going to do some reward stackers and then we're going to do a couple of things that are just author-related, so you can just tip the scales in your balance. This is making sense so far? Can you type in a yep. Are you a little bit risky? Are you kind of neutral? Is it a good deal? Or is it a complete no-brainer? Are we a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 right Now? Just kind of gut check. Okay, so we've got Some 2s We've got some 3s We got some 4s I don't think I've seen a single 1 Or a single 5 I'm pumped that there's no 1s But I think If we can get us Like two blocks along today I think that's time really well spent. Is that okay? If you're already at four, let's just get you to a five. Okay. So, what I'd love to do is just give you five keys right now for fixing up your offer. And then we're going to workshop this and see if we can make your offers better together. So, here's five keys. Please take some notes. Number one. I want to sharpen your promise. This is like the most important thing. It's really important that if I say yes to your offer, whether it's something you sell by chat or it's something you sell by call, that it's really clear that there's not just here are my problems and the thing will kind of generally help me, but that working with you has a specific clear outcome. In other words, if I bought a can of drink called five-hour energy, it's pretty clear that the can of drink is designed to give me five hours of energy, whether it does or not, or whether it's healthy or not, that's beside the point. But the idea, the goal here is to have a promise that if it does what it says on the tin, I'm going to get a great outcome. So, if you think about the promise of your program, can you just type it in the chat? What's the promise of your program right now? We want to sharpen your promise. We want it to be really, really clear, obvious, and easy. And this could be linked to the title of your program, like our program, our front-end program is called Clients. What's its job? Get to your clients. Okay, well, that's pretty clear. Uncover your dream role, make it a reality. More money, get your time back. These are pretty good. Make 10K in 90 days or work with us free until you do. Lisa Barry is winning so far. Three closings a month from your Facebook profile. More clients in the next 10 days. Get a day a week. Carolina, get back a day a week. That's super clear. Three-day weekends or one extra day to work on important stuff. That's fantastic. "Grow your business using a podcast." Okay. "Grow my business using a podcast." It's good. "How much do I grow it?" And then, "How long does it take?" So, promise isn't just "What's the outcome?" But it's "What's the outcome?" "How specific is the outcome?" And then, "How long is it going to take?" In terms of time and effort. Are you with me so far? I want you to think about your promise and go, "Okay, we're going to work this a little bit, but maybe this has already triggered some thoughts, but maybe my stuff's not quite as sharp as it could be." By the way, don't recommend you name your program Black Belt, because half the world thinks you're a karate school. Cool? But the promise of Black Belt is pretty clear. It's get to a million bucks as a business coach. Okay, number one, we want to sharpen your promise. Number two, we want to remove the risk. We've already talked about all of the risks that are involved in saying yes to your offer. Whether it's, I don't know if it's going to work for me, or I'm going to spend a bunch of time, Or I'm going to put some money in here that I could have spent on ads over there. We need to remove the risk. What's the easiest way to remove risk? What's the easiest way? Guarantee. Perfect. Yeah. It's to take the risk out. Years ago, the first marketing book I ever read was called Getting Everything You Can Out of Everything You've Got. Getting Everything You Can Out of All You've Got by Jay Abrams. It's a great marketing book. And he talked about risk reversal and better than risk-free guarantees. And he told this story about a village where a man wanted to buy a horse for his daughter. And at the time, there were two horses for sale. The first guy said, you know, here's my horse. Let's call it 200 bucks. I don't know how much a horse was back then, but let's call it 200 bucks. Here's my horse. It's $200. Take it or leave it. That's horse number one. Horse number two. So the guy goes, okay, so I know that. I'm going to go see the other horse and I'll come back to you. And the guy goes, hey, this is my horse. It's good and it's kind and it's gentle. I think you're going to love it. But of course, I'm going to say that it's my horse and I'm trying to sell it to you. So here's what I suggest. Why don't I get my son to take the horse to your stable, to your house? And he'll show your daughter how to ride it and get them kind of used to each other. Every day I'll get him to drop off some new oats so the horse can eat and feed. He'll clean up the horse's debris, ride it for a week. And at the end of the week, your daughter's either going to love it in which case I'll ask for the $200 or she won't love it, in which case we'll just clean it up. No hard feelings. Which horse do you think the guy bought? Horse number one? Take a leave at horse number two, risk reversed. Of course, they bought horse number two. And so I want you to think about this through the lens your risk reversal. What is there in your, like, what's the current guarantee right now and how safe does it make to spend? You don't have to guarantee the whole program but we need to guarantee the start so people feel safe you can guarantee either way i'm going to jam a little bit on guarantees in a bit but it's one of the uh is your guarantee hot or not can you type in hot 

Taki
i don't 

Taki
know how you spell maybe it's meh or not okay for some people have got a hot guarantee if you think it's hot can you type it in the chat it'll give some people some info Nu am garantie, da? Dacă este hot, poți să-l type în chat, plătește. 90 de zile, îmi place să-l elibere. Cool! 90 de zile, garantie de bani încălzită. Nu am rezultat, îl lucrez cu tine pentru free până când avem rezultatul. Da, plus există pricing în tăie. Da. Jade spune, dacă nu îți scoate cineva în 8 zile în curs, you'll continue to receive the group training for free until you have a signed contract in hand. Asterix, to receive the guarantee, you must have completed the work from the program, showed up on the live calls to get feedback. Yep. Okay, how do we make this super hot? I saw a coach, one of our boardroom guys, whose promise is to get you to 10 grand in X period of time, or we'll refund your money in full and give you $1,000 to go work with someone else because clearly they're going to be a better match for you. Isn't that interesting? So we want to think about how do we take the risk out. That's big idea number two. Number three. Limit supply to raise demand. No, definitely no tacos in that guarantee. Limit supply to raise demand. Pains me to say this, but everybody loves a deadline. And stuff happens when there's a deadline. And so what we want to do is we want to add a little bit of urgency and a little bit of scarcity as to why they need to do it now, not put this off until later on. I don't know if this is something you do. Sometimes it feels a little bit tricky to do in an evergreen enrollment type program. But is there a way that we can reduce the amount of clients we're going to take on at a particular time or shrink the window so people have to join it now and don't wait until later. Jade says, we only work closely with two clients a month. We intake on the third Wednesday of every month. So we've got both. We've got urgency. It's the third Wednesday that's coming up next week. So we've got to be in or out. Yep. Urgency. Scarcity. We're going to talk about limited number, limited time, and how we're going to add urgency even to stuff that isn't urgent, that's evergreen. Okay. In our clients program, for example, currently we just tell people that we start on Tuesday because Tuesday, Australia time Tuesday, is when our calls are. So we always, we start on Tuesday, which like to join us. et ça aide à avoir plus de gens sur la ligne. Une des choses que nous pensons faire, Carrie, quand nous allons à Clients 2.0 et MRR, c'est un grand intérêt par mois, avec le call de kick-off et tout l'associé. Quand nous vendons Black Belt, le call de kick-off est ce jour, et c'est là que notre prochain cohort commence. Ça fait sens? Limiter la supply pour augmenter les demandes. Apparently, the guys who sell diamonds have like vaults full of diamonds waiting there, like mined, sharpened, polished, beautiful, not on the market yet. Because when, if diamonds are everywhere, then diamonds get cheaper. And so what we want to do is they release a certain quantity of diamonds so that the demand goes up and the prices can stay high. Nice background. Yeah, this is lovely, isn't it? Boat's just gone past. Try doing that on your artificial zoom. Aaron says if you don't sell to the beers they flood the market to decrease the price and they're the only ones who buy them that's interesting isn't it ok next up stack the cool this is about bonuses we want to add two or three super high value bonuses that get people to take action right now in the old days it was about the offer stack where you'd add this and that and this and that and this and that and you'd basically search through your hard drives and load as much all the stuff that I had lying around and added to my offer. Nobody, like, maybe in the old days that was cool, but everyone's busy right now. Nobody wants more stuff. Nobody wants more crap in their hard drive. They want stuff that's going to make it faster, going to help them win quicker, or stuff that adds value to the initial offer. And so I just want you to think about the bonuses you add right now. What's one bonus you add that when you do, it gets people frothing? They go, oh my goodness. Yeah. Tamara says, I hate when people write their course with 250 hours of video. No, thanks dude, I haven't got 250 hours. I'm coming to you because I'm busy. Keep the access for 12 months. That's a nice bonus. What else? In Black Belt, we launched this new software, Coach Marketing Machines, CMM. And guess what we do? When you join Black Belt, you can get it for free. People lose their mind. Done for your SWAT kits. Yep. Personalized human design reading to know your unique energy type. Yeah, a way for assessment, huge value. Right, these are all things that add data to the call off and help people win faster. I think speed is the thing. Next thing we want to do, we want to look at, after we've added bonuses, yeah, one-on-one strategy session, offer bonus for stage two. The last thing we want to do is we want to make yes easy. And the way we're going to do that is with a little bit of, a little bit of pricing mechanics, financial engineering, James would call it. And this is really about how do we shape the payment plans so that yes is easier. and this could be like I'm going to give you a few that we've tested. We used to do Black Belt as two months free and then 10 payments of X and then in year two we drop down to regular monthlies. It could be weekly payments like we do in clients right now. It could be a chunk up front and then a lower tail. There's a bunch of different pricing things you can do. So if you think about your pricing, many of us have an up front or a monthly payment plan and there's some clever ways to slice and dice pricing so it feels cheaper but you make more money. Is this making sense? So what we've just covered is five ways to make your offer an easier yes. And what I'd love you to do right now is just out of those five, sharpening my promise, removing the risk with guarantee, urgency and scarcity, bonuses and pricing. Which one of those five feels like the biggest opportunity for you right now? Kari, what are people saying? 

Carrie
People are saying they Jeff says I need all five Jane says bonus Scott, promise 

Carrie
Coop, 

Carrie
make yes easy Alan, promise Todd, promise Lisa, urgency and scarcity Adele, promise 

Carrie
and payment 

Carrie
plan Mark, sharpen and bonuses Lara, five Aaron, guarantee जाइड Maybe pricing for payment or knives. I mean Break Spear says one and three PJ says pricing Ken says limit supply. Tom says promise. David says one Marks has promised. Easy. Yes guarantee promise guarantee guarantee and cool make Yes easy limit supply urgent 

Carrie
everything etc. 

Carrie
Also I 

Carrie
just got a private message that 

Carrie
Lexington is my sound is much better since I changed my mic All 

Taki
is well. That's super great. I love that. So, let's just quickly sketch out this offer diamond and we're going to work on this together. Okay, so James calls it the offer diamond. Looks more like a pentagram to me. But calling it the offer pentagram 

Taki
felt a bit creepy so we're going to keep with diamond. Five things to work on together today, team. Number one, promise. Number two. Guarantee. Pentagon. Yeah. Pentagon's better than pentagram, Scott. You're right. If I hear the word pentagram, I think about, like, candles and sacrificing goats, which I'm not into. Next up. Scarcity. Bonuses. 

Taki
and paid plans. So what we're going to do right now team is we're going to roll up our sleeves and we're going to do a little bit of work here for the next 15 or 20 minutes and sharpen each of these bits up. Let's start with let's start with promise. If you can go to the page which says the program promise, it's a couple of pages down. Goats are delicious. Yes, but like sacrifice to Satan, մի դոց լուս դեխ վլավը պրի կյկ, ամբ այս սամին։ Այքայիկ հետ ացին մատակ ե to get and I want it and it's in a short period of time which feels really doable to me. Perfect world, we've got specific result set time frame, this is small promises are easier to believe and easier to keep. If you're front end program, you don't have to promise to the world, just promise the first sexy step. If your promise is bigger, then obviously the timeline is going to be a little bit extended as well and it wants to be aspirational. Something Thin thighs in 30 days. Like I just told you about. We've got a program called Clients. And its promise is, get yourself clients and get yourself to 10 grand a month. The 20-day new patient bootcamp. Black Belt's promise is, become a million-dollar coach. Bigger promise, longer time period. 10K in 10 weeks. That's really the client's promise. So these are just some examples. What I'd love you to do is just fill in this box right now for you with your current offer. Just finish this sentence. il programma è disegnato per insert promise qui vi darò 30 secondi 30 secondi e tomorrow se potete suonare un po' di tune per un minuto sarebbe ottimo 

Taki
grazie Thank you. 

Taki
Nice. We should be able to clearly say the program is designed to. Now, can you promise their outcome? You can't promise their outcome 'cause you don't know their implementation, but you can say it's designed to. Three minute abs, exactly right. You can't even raise a sweat in three minutes, Steve. I don't know what you're talking about. As soon as you've got it written down, just give me a wave so I know. Yep, okay. So here's the question I've got for you. When you look at what you've currently got and compare it to goals and examples, are there any ideas that come up for you in terms of making your promise better? Can you pop your ideas down in the insights box down there? Are there any insights you've got to make your promise sharper, shorter, more specific? Adele, can you type yours in? Numbers and timelines is exactly what we want. How much by when? Every one of us sells some kind of results, some kind of outcome. and if it feels softer then we just need to figure out how we quantify that thing mine only hits one Problem I in like first, then and first, next and then. First, we'll choose the right Savings and Superfund for you so that every Dollar you make from now on builds you wealth. So first, we choose the right thing. Then you'll start to see your income, like not spending it all, but starting to save. And then over time, you'll grow this nest egg. I think that's fine. If we can go first, then and like first, next and then, I think we're okay. Heather, can you speak to this for a second? هيدر روبطس، هل يمكنك الإنشاء؟ و أهداء تومارا، إذا كانت تمكنك إضطرار "هيدر" سيكون هذا جيداً "هيدر" ما تغيرت منه و منه؟

حسناً، نحن نقوم بالتحسن بمضيناتنا و أحصل على نقصات مفاجئة ثانياً،

Carrie
And then 

BB Member 1
the price goes up. And then the thing that we stacked on is something that is super, super valuable in our world, in our people, which is an assessment of their biggest account. Like, what are you doing right? What are you doing wrong? And what do you need to do over the next X, Y, Z, six months to make it better? So this whole thing all together, it like literally it was the jam that we were missing. Y, bueno, We're selling this off of one call, no thought. They're like, oh my God, I'm an idiot if I don'T do this. 

Taki
Yes. 

Carrie
¿Helps? 

Taki
Exactly right. Well, yeah, it helps a lot. Thank you. 

Carrie
Rhonda wants to know if you can kind of spell it out for us. If you could just give us a little example, like what you've added to the phrasing, 

BB Member 1
just super brief. Yeah. So our promise usedと be, oh, we'll help you set up and grow your eCommerce sales channel, Now we say we will guarantee that you will have five to seven e-commerce internet retail accounts. Then we go on to say that we have a 90-day love or leave it and we have our tiered pricing. 

Carrie
And 

BB Member 1
then we say, hey, for the first five people who join this are going to get this assessment, which, oh, by the way, is worth $7,000. And we go in and assess their top selling account. And we say, this is what you're doing well. This is what your improvements need to be. And these are the action steps you need to take to make it happen. So we give them this free plan. And then we've done our pricing. So like the first month was $500, $1,000, $1,500, two grand, two fourths. So we've made it really, really easy. So that's specifically what we've done. And then on top of it, we add the testimonials that say, hey, people who followed our advice have, you know, gone from, you know, zero to 25,000 a month and within, you know, three months. And that's counting the 

Taki
lag time 

BB Member 1
and leaving all that. Is that more 

Taki
specifically helpful? Yeah, that's really helpful. Thank you. That's really great. So what I love about this is you've taken all of the parts of the Alpha Pentagon Diamond и сега ги Ok, ja ću ti daj 30 sekundi svega za tvoje ideje. Sve 3 poslige stvari da ćeš testirati promis-wise, i onda ćeš ih testirati u sales call-u u sljedećem mjesecu ili dvije. Da. risk out of it for people so that it's safe to spend best practices we want to reward good behavior and so this is like you might have a an action-based guarantee so the guarantee applies if you do x y and z for example Rob Nixon who's recovering from some time in the burns unit last week not super fun uh his promise is we will for every year like when you first do you'll add 300 000 extra profit I think it might be per partner but extra profit for your accounting firm in the next 12 months or you don't pay that's pretty damn good dot dot dot provided you show up to your four meetings a year and the four masterminds and you complete the projects that you commit to well that sounds fair enough so that's an action based guarantee you can do no questions asked yeah that's a no questions asked which is hey if you don't like it if it doesn't work for you for any reason or no reason at all, let me know and I'll buy it back from you at full price. No questions asked. Good for front-end courses. Make it safe to start. You don't have to promise a big result at the end of the year, but we can just make the first month or two months or three months safe, if that makes sense. So, Rob, 300k in extra profit every year provided you 1, 2, 3. Go up to the meetings, complete the projects that you say you'll do. I'll buy it back from you at full price. By the way, buy it back from you is better than give you a full refund. Buy it back from you makes it feel valuable. At full price plus, I'll give you an extra 10 bucks for a plate of tacos on May. Is it tricky to deliver? Yeah, of course. But it makes it clear and obvious that you're a good dude and you'll keep your word so they're safe. Our current black belt guarantee is 120 days, one full cycle. What we realized, we used to do a 90-day level to leave it for a period. So, somebody would join and they had 90 days to love it or leave it. And any time in the 90 days, they could bounce. And that's totally fine. It makes it safe. We've changed our guarantee. And it's now this. You start 

Carrie
here. 

Taki
In 120 days, they will have done a full cycle. So, they will have done a half-time. They will have done a Black Belt event. The best part about Black Belt, I reckon the emotional high is the intensive. And this gets everyone through the intensive. And so, the deal is, give us 120 days. At the end of 120 days, if you don't like it, then you can leave it. No hard feelings at all. But you need to commit to the 120 days. Is that fair enough? They're like, yeah. So there's some examples of guarantees for you. I'd love you to just go, what's my current risk reversal? I'll give you 30 seconds right now. Actually, I'll give you a minute to go, what's my current? And are there any ideas that pop from having compared what I'm currently doing to best practice? Tamara, if you could give us some tunes. If you want some feedback on yours, type them into the chat like Jade's doing and into the chat we'll give you some feedback. Yep. 30-day level leave, if that makes it safe to spend, totally cool. If 30 days is enough for them to check you out and you to check them out, like two dogs sniffing each other's butts in a park, cool. Optional weekly 20s until you've paid for the program. Yeah, do they pay? Yeah, of course they pay for the 120 days. Yep. So we've just upped the commitment level a little bit. What are your thoughts about drip feeding the content over time so they have more to look forward to if they stay? Yeah, dude, I really like that. If you have a front-end program and that's what they do first, and once they complete it, then they, after the guarantee period, you open up the next levels, I think that's cool. It also reduces overwhelm. Tobias, I like it. Tom says 100k in 90 days or we'll work with you until you do. Tom, if you can deliver that, that's super sexy, mate. I love it. Michael and Tony say, Lisa, we say we can't promise a lawyer would have kittens, but our goal is Or we know with 100% certainty That if you do the work you'll get the results But like pushups we can show you how to do them But we can't do them for you That's how you handle the promised peace That's interesting And if they say I'm out at 120 days We don t refund We just can't tear up the agreement Because they've kept their word And we've kept ours Mark says generally don't sniff their butts But I like the analogy Yeah, I agree Butt sniffing is a bit creepy if you're a dog it's fine if you're a grown up probably don't ok what can we do to sharpen up your your risk reversal team if you've got some ideas about how to make your 

Taki
thing a complete no brainer what can we do 

Taki
there's no guarantees in life. The only thing I can promise is that if you don't do the work, you won't get the results. Some people do that. Aaron says change level to leave it from 30 days to 90 days and then 12 months commitment. Yeah, we do 120 days and then 12 months. Jade, I love the, I'm just looking in the chat here. Jade, I love the guarantee. I just think I'd word the asterisk part a little more friendly. So, to receive the guarantee, you must have completed the work from the program and one of you need to have shown up on the live calls to receive feedback. So, you know, that's our part. We need you to do yours. That means you'll be covered by the guarantee if you do the work and shop the calls. Ja, 12 months from the 128 is exactly how we do it. That's a lot of words. It needs to be cleared up, Mario. Exactly right. So here's what we've talked about so far. We've talked about promise. And promise adds reward. We've talked about guarantee, which removes risk. James, I love that. Okay, we're just sharpening up pieces. I will go pricing after. Let's go to scarcity. If you've got an Evergreen thing, the reason launches work so well for people who do launches, the reason launch to do so well is because it's available now and it's not available later. If your program is Evergreen, how can we add a little bit of that scarcity to it? So we can lower supply to increase demand. We work with like... How many clients are you onboarding a month right now? And maybe you can just raise that number a little bit and go, we only work with, if you were currently onboard five clients a month, as an example, we Only work with eight clients a month and it now feels scarce, right? No fake scarcity. So if you're going to say something, it needs to be real. Fast action bonuses. So this is like, if you're one at the first three or one at the first five, like Heather talked about, You get this, that, and the other thing. We'll talk about bonuses in a little bit. Examples. A couple of weeks ago, James Kemp offered 10 spots in TMM Pro. Yeah, exactly. The first 24 hours. Exactly right. How do we do scarcity in clients? We mostly use urgency in clients and we say that we start on Tuesday. Okay? And we're going to go to a monthly launch model. The first five people get X, Y, and Z. We start on Tuesday. Our next intake, this is from the July event. Our next intake is August 4. So there's a deadline involved. So what's your current urgency? Or scarcity? Put in your car. I'll give you 30 seconds, Tamara. appearing bonuses can work. Yes. Кэрри, can you speak to that for 30 seconds while people are writing? 

Carrie
Yeah, if your bonuses are sexy enough and we've talked about chocolate and broccoli before. If the chocolate like is sexy enough and they're buying it for the bonus, we've all done that. We've bought for the bonus, then they'll want to be one of the first ones so that they don't miss the bonus. Maybe your scarcity is in the amount of bonuses that you have. If it's a one-to-one or if it's an audit of some kind or a tangible something or a hard product, if you can do real scarcity with that, that can work. Also, a disappearing payment plan can work. So, if you get 

Carrie
in, we're 

Carrie
only going to accept 10 for cash flow purposes. We're only going to take 10 people on the scale-up payment plan. Everybody else is going to have to come in with the full down payment. Um, so if you can be one of the five, you know, that's another thing to get your fence tippers on one side or the other. 

Taki
I love that. So, guys, can we, I think just to share the love, can you type into the chat either your, if your current scarcity and urgency is great, type that in or your idea into the chat and that'll just give people a bunch of ideas and inspiration. 

Carrie
Yeah, we love a price increase urgency too. That's how Michael That's how Matt Kimberly just pulled 60k out of his list last week was just announcing 

Taki
a price increase to 7 days. 

Carrie
Yep, 

Taki
exactly right. We intake twice a month. We only work with X a month and there's X spots left. Yep, we intentionally only work with 5 new people a week giving them direct feedback, contributing social media content to get you moving fast. Yep, only 6 members involved. I love this. And obviously, the moment you're hitting your 6 consistently, what can you do? You can go we only work with 8 members a month. And you can just ramp it up as you go and grow. Λόγω αυτού. Εντάξει, ας μιλήσουμε για τους γνώσεις. Η γνώσης που φτιάχνει γνώσεις. Ας μιλήσουμε λίγο για γνώσεις. Πρέπει να είναι συμμετοχή. Είναι σημαντικό να είναι επαναγγελματικό με την αρχή του πρόγραμμα. Είναι σημαντικό να είναι γερμανικοί για να μπορούμε να βοηθήσουμε την ποιότητα. Θέματα που βοηθούν την άποψη των ανθρώπων και να μπορούμε να καταλήξουμε ακόμα γρήγορα. Ένα φίλος μου, η before you go on stage that removes your stage notes. Sales and intimacy opportunities. So this is like a chance to work one-onone or in a small group. And like we just talked about stuff for the first five or first whatever, or by deadline. If you join by this time, your team is going to be and if you join later, you don't. So examples, small group call, done before you, like Sidekick Virtual Assistant to implement stuff for you, tools like coach marketing machine or a dump for your website, scripts, templates like a webinar template. They're just some examples. What do you currently bonus? What do you currently bonus right now? I'll give you a minute to go: what are the current bonuses? Any insights? And then how do we make them even better? 

Taki
A question, what do you do when the prospect says, "Why isn't that included in the program anyway?" Because it takes time, and energy, and money. 

Taki
I think all you need to do is have a reason and then say, "Is that fair enough?" They'll say, "Yes." So what can you bonus in? That helps people win faster, or overcomes an objection? or that gets people closer to you and rewards fast action. We're going to do a quick brainstorm right now. What could we do or add? Jade, all of your stuff is quite wordy. If it's done in a, like a sell by chat doc, I think it's completely fine. And if it's done on a call, obviously you don't, you know, that's only, like it looks wordy here because we're in a Zoom chat and it's short, එක් ප්රින් එකු 

Carrie
because they're not necessarily required for implementation. Just nice to have for those of them that want to invest in a next level. But in order to keep this at this price, we have to keep the blah, blah, blah separate. 

Taki
Yeah, I like that. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, Carrie, good job. That's a great plus one. What I'd love you to do, Tine, into the chat is type in some bonus ideas that you could add and that'll help everybody get some inspiration. Into the chat, please. You got 10 seconds. What's one bonus idea that could help move people off the fence quicker? Carrie, could your read 

Carrie
messenger mentoring for a week. So that's access and intimacy like that. Brian says over the shoulder videos. They love these Adele says 12 months access. So you have plenty of time to implement everything. Kylie says hours with the VA to help with implementation. Stephanie says holiday social media templates for the year free strategy session, free social audit, free systems audit free marketing audit. I always hesitate to use the word free. I उद ल 

Taki
What I suggest, perhaps you do, guys, at the end of this session, just download the chat, and you'll have a bunch of ideas for your stuff. Okay? Let's talk pricing. James did an epic session at the July intensive on financial engineering, just how to price your stuff differently. And so it's not just about, like, it's not, I'm going to lower my price. It's definitely not that. It's, like, how do we change the payment plans so that the stuff is an easy yes? What we want is a price that makes it easy for them to get an ROI, ideally so that the thing pays for itself quickly. So if they're paying you two grand a month, how quickly do we get two grand a month back into their account? And so we just want to be able to justify it. Like how much do they make? How much is one client worth to them? How much is your stuff worth? Do you think perhaps in the next little while we can get you at least one client? Of course we can. we will align our thing with the outcome so this links to milestones specifically if our goal is to get you to you know 10k a month then we want a payment plan that isn't 50 you know we want payments that isn't 50 grand it needs to be commensurate with the return they're going to get and the outcome they can get over time one of the things that we've talked about a little bit today is stepping up pricing so black belt right now is 1500 first month 2 grand, 2nd month and then 2.5 a month after that so that it's an easy yes, and our job is to get them a ROI before they've made the big investment and then it's 2.5 a month forever so some examples $600 a week, weekly pricing makes it really easy to do this, if you take your, it's like sponsoring a child, they get it down to a cup of coffee a day so can we go to weekly pricing some of us offer a pay in full or a monthly price. And so you pay a little bit more. One you save a little bit of money and one is better on your cash flow. And then this is graduated pricing. What could you do right now? What's your current pricing and how could you change payment plans? I'll give you a minute for what's my current payment system and what could I tweak. Ready, set, go. $300 a month feels cheap but you go to $100 a week which feels even cheaper and make more money Adele? 

Carrie
Yes 

Taki
Yeah, 5k

Ok, so we've looked at a bunch of A bunch of hacks Bonuses and promise and pricing And guarantees and scarcity I want you to just go back to the The seesaw we did at the start of today's session Whatever number you're on before Whether it was a 2 Or a 3 or a 4 If you implement the things we've just talked about What's the new number? Assuming you include the stuff we've just talked about 4s and 5s what we're hoping for here yeah perfect amazing love the seesaw model yeah perfect so here's what I here's what I want you to think about team is is for the next month let's test these hacks and you're going to sharpen and tweak like we're forever sharpening and tweaking this stuff but you're going to you're going to sharpen and tweak this and test it with real life people in chat and in calls and see if our conversion rate improves. If we do our job right, it should significantly bump your conversion rate and make it much, much easier for people to take a jump on you. So we talked about promise, which increases reward. We talked about guarantee. We talked about bonuses. We talked about payment plans, which reduce the risk. And then urgency and scarcity is like you standing on the thing y being able to just lean a little bit heavier here. So all I want you to do right now, team, is go to the very first page in your book, Insight Snapshot. I'm going to give you 60 seconds right now. What are your top three insights, actions, takeaways, and ideas from today's session? You've got 60 seconds. Ready, set, go. Amazing. And stop. So we've got some got some insights, got some actions. I'd just love to find out best things from you. What did you learn? What did you love from this session on the offer diamond? Into the chat, what did you get? What's one specific thing that you could steal from this to make your business better? Best things. Come on, team. Payment plan away. Get clear. My offer needs to be communicated in a more compelling, irresistible way. Sharpen my promise for the soft stuff, says Simon. Yes. Bonuses. Getting to use risk-reward ratio for my next intensive. You're welcome. And need to review them all, but immediately implement 120-day level to leave it. I love that. Clear on promise. Put back guarantee. Reduce the risk. Bonuses. Yes. Clear on the outcome in specific time. These are awesome. $250 a week instead of $1,800 a month. Love that, Aaron. Okay. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to take a break right now for seven minutes. seven minutes uh set
