# The Offer Diamond Framework for Converting Prospects

## Overview: The Risk-Reward Balance

This training session introduces the "Offer Diamond" framework, originally developed by James Kent, which focuses on balancing the risk-reward ratio in sales offers. The core principle is that prospects say "yes" when the reward outweighs the risk, and say "no" when risk feels too high. The goal is to stack rewards and remove risks to make purchasing decisions as close to "no-brainers" as possible.

## The Five Keys to Optimizing Your Offer

### 1. **Sharpen Your Promise**
The promise must be specific, clear, and include three elements:
- **Specific outcome** (what they get)
- **Quantifiable result** (how much)
- **Timeframe** (by when)

Best practices include making promises aspirational yet believable. For front-end programs, promise the "first sexy step" rather than the entire transformation. Examples shared: "Make 10K in 90 days," "Get clients in the next 10 days," "Become a million-dollar coach."

### 2. **Remove the Risk with Guarantees**
Using the horse-buying analogy (two sellers, one with "take it or leave it" vs. one offering a trial period), the session emphasized making it safe to start. Three types of guarantees discussed:

- **Action-based guarantees**: Tied to client completion of specific actions
- **No-questions-asked guarantees**: Full refund for any reason (best for front-end courses)
- **Time-based guarantees**: 30-day, 90-day, or 120-day "love it or leave it" periods

Key tip: Use "buy it back from you" language rather than "refund" to increase perceived value.

### 3. **Create Urgency and Scarcity**
Even for evergreen programs, add deadline pressure through:
- **Limited spots**: "We only work with X clients per month"
- **Fast-action bonuses**: First 3-5 people get special bonuses
- **Intake dates**: Specific start dates (e.g., "We start on Tuesday," "Next intake is August 4")
- **Price increases**: Announce upcoming price changes with 7-day deadlines
- **Disappearing payment plans**: Limited spots for favorable payment terms

Important: No fake scarcity—only use real limitations.

### 4. **Stack High-Value Bonuses**
Modern bonuses should help clients win faster, not just add volume. Focus on:
- Things that **speed up results**
- Items that **overcome objections**
- Opportunities for **access and intimacy** (one-on-one time, small group calls)
- **Done-for-you elements** (templates, audits, assessments)

Examples shared: Free software tools, VA hours for implementation, personalized assessments worth $7,000, over-the-shoulder videos, extended access periods.

When prospects ask "Why isn't this included?" respond with a clear reason and "Is that fair enough?"

### 5. **Engineer Payment Plans**
Don't just lower prices—restructure them strategically:
- **Weekly payments**: Makes costs feel smaller (e.g., $100/week vs. $400/month)
- **Graduated pricing**: Start low, increase over time (e.g., $1,500 first month, $2,000 second month, then $2,500/month)
- **Pay-in-full discounts** vs. payment plans
- Align pricing with ROI milestones to ensure the program pays for itself

The goal is pricing that makes ROI achievement obvious and easy.

## Implementation Strategy

The framework uses a "seesaw" or "pentagon/diamond" visual with five points:
1. Promise (increases reward)
2. Guarantee (removes risk)
3. Scarcity (tips the balance)
4. Bonuses (increases reward)
5. Payment Plans (reduces perceived risk)

## Case Study: E-commerce Program Transformation

One participant (Heather) shared her successful implementation:
- **Promise**: Guarantee 5-7 e-commerce retail accounts
- **Guarantee**: 90-day "love it or leave it" with tiered pricing
- **Bonus**: $7,000 assessment of top account for first 5 people (identifying what's working, what needs improvement, action steps)
- **Pricing**: Graduated monthly increases ($500, $1,000, $1,500, $2,000, $2,400)
- **Result**: Selling off one call with no hesitation—"Oh my God, I'm an idiot if I don't do this"

## Action Items

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Review and sharpen your program promise to include specific outcome + timeframe
2. Evaluate your current guarantee and consider upgrading to 90-120 day "love it or leave it"
3. Add 2-3 high-value bonuses that accelerate results
4. Restructure pricing to weekly or graduated payments
5. Implement real scarcity through limited spots or intake dates

**Testing Period:**
- Test these optimizations in real sales conversations (chat and calls) over the next month
- Track conversion rate improvements
- Continue refining based on results

**Expected Outcome:**
Participants reported moving from 2-4 on the "no-brainer scale" to 4-5 after implementing these strategies, with expectations of significantly improved conversion rates.
