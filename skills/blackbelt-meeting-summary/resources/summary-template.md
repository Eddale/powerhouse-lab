# BlackBelt Meeting Summary Template

This is the reference template for generating meeting summaries. The skill uses this format
to create Basecamp-ready updates.

## Voice Guidelines

- Ed Dale's voice: clear, direct, practical
- Bond Halbert tight edits. No fluff. Short sentences.
- Australian English
- Compassionate amusement. Celebrate real wins. Call out what's cool.
- Plain language. Avoid jargon unless transcript uses it.
- **Highlight areas of concern** - reality makes these valuable

## Output Structure (250-400 words)

```
**[Client Name] — [Call Type] Summary**
Coach: Ed Dale

**Summary:**
- 2-3 short paragraphs
- Include 1-3 direct quotes from client (attribute with name + role)
- State core outcome(s), main shift/decision, any milestone
- Highlight areas of concern if present

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Bulleted list of main topics/systems discussed

**Trainings Highlighted / Assigned:**
- Label-only (no links)

**Requests / Follow-Ups for the Blackbelt Team:**
- Explicit requests made on the call (ops team visibility)

- Potential issues in energy, language, emotion

**Next Steps / Action Items:**

```

## Requirements

- Be faithful to the transcript. Do not invent facts.
- Keep total length tight (target 250-400 words).
- No hyperlinks in the Trainings section.
- If a role isn't stated, add a brief clarifier only when obvious from transcript.

## Session Types

| Type | Duration | Focus |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Game Plan** | 45min-2hr | Onboarding strategy, setting foundations |
| **Velocity** | 20min | Progress check, adjustments, next steps |
| **Red** | 20min | Emergency/issue resolution |

## Direct Quote Guidelines

When including client quotes:
- Attribute with name + role for context
- Example: "Christy's confidence has gone through the roof." — Bren, Founder
- Choose quotes that capture wins, confidence, clarity, or momentum
- If role isn't stated, add clarifier only when obvious (e.g., "Christy = Head of Sales")

## Areas of Concern

Don't shy away from noting concerns:
- Language patterns that suggest doubt or overwhelm
- Energy drops Ed specifically points out
- Missed commitments or recurring blockers
- Team dynamics issues

Reality makes these summaries valuable. Sugar-coating helps no one.
