# Manga Style Guide

## The Default Aesthetic

High contrast, black and white manga illustration with bold linework. Clean, professional, scroll-stopping.

**Core characteristics:**
- Black and white (no color unless specified)
- High contrast linework
- Clean backgrounds (white or minimal)
- Expressive characters
- Text as dominant visual element

## Visual Elements

### Linework

- **Bold outlines** - Thick, confident lines
- **High contrast** - Black lines on white, no muddy grays
- **Clean edges** - No sketchy or rough lines
- **Consistent weight** - Same line thickness throughout

### Characters

**Expression range for reactions:**
- **Shock/Surprise** - Wide eyes, open mouth, sweat drops, speed lines radiating
- **Realization** - Narrowed eyes, slight smile, lightbulb moment
- **Frustration** - Gritted teeth, furrowed brow, stress marks
- **Confidence** - Relaxed posture, knowing smile, calm eyes
- **Despair** - Head in hands, dark cloud, slumped shoulders

**Character positioning:**
- Usually in lower half of frame
- Looking at or reacting to the text
- Body language reinforces the message

### Speed Lines & Effects

- **Radial speed lines** - Emanating from focal point for impact
- **Horizontal speed lines** - For motion/urgency
- **Shock marks** - Small lines around head for surprise
- **Sweat drops** - For stress or nervousness
- **Dark aura** - For ominous statements

### Text Treatment

**In-image text rules:**
- Bold sans-serif font
- High contrast (black on white or white on black)
- Top third of frame (usually)
- Massive scale - text should dominate
- No more than 2-3 lines

**Text effects:**
- Strike-through for "old" information
- Size emphasis for key words
- Color accent (red) for critical points (use sparingly)

## Composition Rules

### The Hierarchy Principle

1. **Text comes FIRST** - It's the main visual
2. **Character supports** - Reaction reinforces the text
3. **Background recedes** - Clean, minimal, doesn't compete

### Layout Patterns

**Pattern A: Text Top, Character Bottom**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   TEXT HERE     │
│   (massive)     │
├─────────────────┤
│   [character    │
│    reacting]    │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Pattern B: Text Center, Character Side**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│                 │
│   TEXT HERE     │ [character]
│                 │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Pattern C: Full-Frame Text (Hook slides)**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│                 │
│   TEXT HERE     │
│   (fills frame) │
│                 │
│ [small reaction]│
└─────────────────┘
```

### Negative Space

- **Essential for readability**
- Clean area around text
- Let the image breathe
- White space is your friend

## What to Avoid

### Busy Backgrounds
- No detailed environments
- No multiple objects
- No competing visual elements

### Color (Unless Specified)
- Stick to black and white
- Red accent only for critical emphasis
- Color dilutes the manga aesthetic

### Multiple Focal Points
- ONE thing for the eye to go to
- Everything else supports that one thing

### Realistic Style
- Not photorealistic
- Not semi-realistic
- Pure manga/anime aesthetic

### Competing Text
- No secondary text
- No captions within the image
- No watermarks or labels

## Style Variants

### Default: Clean Reaction
- White background
- Bold text top
- Character reacting bottom
- Maximum clarity

### Variant: Dynamic Action
- Speed lines throughout
- Character in motion
- More energy, same clarity

### Variant: Narrator Mode
- Ed as illustrated character
- Part of the scene, not just reacting
- Use for explainer-style content
- Requires reference image

## Consistency Across Carousel

**To maintain visual consistency:**
- Same character style throughout
- Same line weight
- Same text treatment
- Same background approach
- Same aspect ratio (4:5)

**Between slides:**
- Consider using same character across all slides
- Vary poses and expressions
- Keep style consistent even as content changes

## Technical Specifications

- **Aspect ratio:** 4:5 (Instagram optimal)
- **Style keywords:** "Manga illustration, high contrast linework, black and white"
- **Background:** "Clean white background" or "minimal background"
- **Text instruction:** Always include "TEXT TO RENDER:" with exact copy
