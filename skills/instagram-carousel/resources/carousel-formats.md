   - 5+ points → Listicle

2. **Is there a clear before/after?**
   - Yes → Before/After structure
   - No → Standard or Listicle

3. **Is this a personal story?**
   - Yes → Story Arc
   - No → Standard or Listicle

4. **Is it a list of things?**
   - Yes → Listicle
   - No → Standard

## Slide Transitions

- **Value → Value:** "And that's not all..." or "Even more importantly..."
- **Value → Summary:** "So what does this mean?"
- **Summary → CTA:** "Here's what to do..."
