# Carousel Formats

## Core Principle

The slide count serves the AHA moment. Use 6-8 slides - enough to deliver real value, not so many you lose them.

---

## Standard 8-Slide Structure (Default)

Best for: Teaching content, articles with 3+ insights, transformation stories.

| Slide | Purpose | Char Target | What It Does |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Hook** | 80-120 | Stop the scroll, create open loop |
| 2 | **Turn** | 10-30 | Punchy pivot, sets up the value |
| 3-6 | **Value** | 80-180 | Deliver teaching, insights, proof |
| 7 | **Pattern/Medicine** | 120-180 | The insight that ties it together |
| 8 | **CTA** | 80-120 | Engagement question + follow prompt |

**Character count philosophy:**
- **Short slides (10-30):** Punchy impact. "Old advice kills." Stop. Let it land.
- **Value slides (80-180):** TEACH something. This is where value lives.
- **Hook/CTA (80-120):** Substantial but scannable.

## Condensed 6-Slide Structure

Best for: Simpler topics, single insight, tighter execution.

| Slide | Purpose | Char Target |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Hook** | 80-120 |
| 2 | **Turn/Problem** | 30-60 |
| 3-4 | **Value** | 80-180 |
| 5 | **Insight** | 120-180 |
| 6 | **CTA** | 80-120 |

Use this when 8 slides would mean padding.

## Story Arc Structure (8 slides)

Best for: Personal stories, case studies, narrative content with emotional journey.

| Slide | Story Beat | Char Target |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Hook: Tease the transformation | 80-120 |
| 2 | Setup: The starting situation | 60-100 |
| 3 | Conflict: What went wrong | 80-150 |
| 4 | Low point: The moment of doubt | 80-150 |
| 5 | Turning point: The realization | 80-180 |
| 6 | Resolution: What changed | 80-150 |
| 7 | Lesson: The takeaway | 120-180 |
| 8 | CTA | 80-120 |

---

## Listicle Structure (6-8 slides)

Best for: "X things you need to know", "X mistakes", "X reasons why".

| Slide | Content | Char Target |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Hook: "5 reasons your business is stalling" | 80-120 |
| 2-6 | List items with VALUE (not just bullet points) | 80-180 each |
| 7 | Summary/Pattern | 120-180 |
| 8 | CTA | 80-120 |

**Key:** Each list item should teach something, not just state something.

## Visual Progression Table Template

**Use this to plan the visual story alongside the content:**

| Slide | Text Summary | Metaphor State | Character Action | Energy |
|-------|--------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| 1 | [Hook] | [Start state - chaos/problem] | [Initial reaction] | High |
| 2 | [Turn] | [Slight shift begins] | [Noticing] | Medium-High |
| 3 | [Value 1] | [Progress visible] | [Engaging] | Medium |
| 4 | [Value 2] | [More progress] | [Following along] | Medium |
| 5 | [Value 3] | [Momentum building] | [Getting it] | Medium-High |
| 6 | [Value 4] | [Near resolution] | [Anticipating] | Rising |
| 7 | [Pattern] | [Resolution revealed] | [Aha moment] | Peak |
| 8 | [CTA] | [Final state - clarity] | [Peaceful/satisfied] | Calm |

**Why this matters:** Without this table, each slide is nice on its own but there's no JOURNEY. The table forces you to plan the arc.

## Choosing the Right Format

Ask these questions:

1. **How many teaching points?**
   - 1-2 points → 6-slide
   - 3-4 points → 8-slide
   - 5+ points → Consider splitting into two carousels

2. **Is there a clear before/after?**
   - Yes → Story Arc structure
   - No → Standard or Listicle

3. **Is this a personal story?**
   - Yes → Story Arc
   - No → Standard or Listicle

4. **Is it a list of things?**
   - Yes → Listicle
   - No → Standard

5. **Can I deliver the AHA in 6 slides?**
   - Yes → Condensed
   - No → Full 8

## Slide Transitions

Each slide should create pull to the next. Patterns:

- **Hook → Turn:** "Here's what's happening..."
- **Turn → Value:** "Let me show you..."
- **Value → Value:** "And here's the thing..." or "Even more..."
- **Value → Pattern:** "So what does this mean?"
- **Pattern → CTA:** "Here's what to do about it..."

**Open loops:** Don't resolve everything on each slide. Leave a thread that pulls them forward.

## Caption Structure

```
[Hook line - expand or riff on Slide 1]

[Body - 3-5 bullets summarizing the value]
→ Point 1
→ Point 2
→ Point 3

[Insight - the "so what"]

[Engagement question - status-appropriate]

[CTA - save, share, follow]

👇 [Pointer to slides if needed]

[Hashtags - 5-10 relevant tags at the end]
```

**Rules:**
- First line must hook (it's the preview)
- Use → arrows for easy scanning
- Engagement question mirrors Slide 8
- Hashtags at the end, not inline
