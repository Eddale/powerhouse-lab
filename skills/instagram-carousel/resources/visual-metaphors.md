# Visual Metaphor Library

## How to Use This Library

This is **inspiration, not a menu**. The best metaphor emerges from the article itself.

Before selecting a metaphor:
1. What transformation does the article describe?
2. What tension or contrast exists in the content?
3. What would resonate with THIS specific audience?

The metaphor should feel inevitable once you see it - like it was always the right choice.

## Creating Your Own Metaphor

If none of these fit, ask:

1. **What's the BEFORE state?** (chaos, confusion, struggle, stuck)
2. **What's the AFTER state?** (clarity, success, flow, freedom)
3. **What PROCESS connects them?** (cutting, tuning, assembling, revealing)
4. **What OBJECT or SCENE embodies that process?**

The best metaphors are:
- **Visual** (can be drawn)
- **Progressive** (has clear stages)
- **Universal** (audience immediately gets it)
- **Resonant** (feels right for this specific message)
