# Secondary Character Library

## Why Use a Secondary Character?

A character adds:
- **Emotional amplification** - their reactions guide viewer emotions
- **Visual continuity** - same character across slides creates story
- **Warmth and personality** - makes the carousel memorable
- **Storytelling depth** - character arc parallels the message

The character should **amplify, not compete**. They're the supporting actor, not the star.

## Using Characters Effectively

### DO:
- Keep character in **background or corner** - never center stage
- Give character **clear emotional state** per slide
- Use character to **guide viewer's eye** to the message
- Plan character arc that **parallels the content arc**

### DON'T:
- Let character **overshadow the message**
- Give character **dialogue** (they react, not speak)
- Use character **inconsistently** between slides
- Choose character that **doesn't fit the tone**

## Character Arc Planning Template

Use this format in the Visual Progression Table:

| Slide | Character Action/State |
|-------|------------------------|
| 1 | [How they react to the hook] |
| 2 | [Response to the turn/problem] |
| 3-6 | [Growing engagement with value points] |
| 7 | [Insight landing - character gets it] |
| 8 | [Resolution - character at peace/satisfied] |

## When NOT to Use a Character

Skip the character when:
- Content is **very serious** (life/death, grief, heavy topics)
- Metaphor is **strong enough alone** (character would clutter)
- User specifically requests **literal visuals**
- Tone is **formal or corporate**

Characters add warmth. Sometimes the content needs space without warmth.
