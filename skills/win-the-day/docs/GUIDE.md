# Win The Day - How It Works

## The One-Sentence Version

Your morning co-pilot: metrics, captures, tasks - all in one flow, done in 5 minutes.

## Why This Exists

Every morning has the same questions:
- What's in my inbox?
- What meetings do I have?
- What captures came in overnight?
- What should I focus on today?

Checking each of these separately = death by a thousand tabs. Win The Day runs the whole sequence so you start each day with clarity, not chaos.

## The Gary Halbert Analogy

Gary talked about "clearing the decks" before writing. You can't create when your mind is cluttered with open loops.

Win The Day is deck-clearing. In 5 minutes you know:
- The lay of the land (metrics)
- What came in (captures)
- What's on deck (tasks)

Then you're free to focus on Ship This = Win Day.

## The Pipeline

**Step 1: Metrics** - "What's the landscape?"
- Email unreads (Gmail + iCloud)
- Today's meetings
- Tomorrow preview
- Any urgent flags

**Step 2: Captures** - "What came in?"
- Mobile notes from Drafts
- Quick triage: task, idea, research, or trash?
- Route to Ready section

**Step 3: Tasks** - "What needs doing?"
- Today's 3 check
- Stale item review
- Clarify anything fuzzy

**Step 4: Summary** - "Here's the situation"
- One consolidated report
- Key priority highlighted
- Ready to win

## How You Use It

Just say: "win the day"

Claude runs through all four steps, asking for input where needed, then hands you a morning briefing.

For hands-off mode: "win the day automatically"
- Skips interactive prompts
- Just gives you the status report
